Updated: April 5, 2017 to address some incompleteness and errors. You can view the revision history here.\n\nApplication Services is a framework in iOS and OS X which provides what's known as the Image I/O framework. ImageIO itself is a collection of utilities and data types for parsing various image formats. It's used in many OS X and iOS applications including:\n\nTweetbot\nSafari\nMessages\nMail\nPreview\n\nSome popular applications that do not use ImageIO include:\n\nChrome\nFirefox\nTelegram\n\nGiven the impact of media processing bugs such as Stagefright I decided that this would be a good target for fuzzing. I created a simple application that uses some various features of ImageIO, grabbed a small PNG I had on my desktop which happened to be a screenshot, and let afl run.\nI checked on my fuzzer after 30 minutes and already a crash!\nHere's the code used: Gist (this is almost verbatim Apple's ImageIO sample).\nNote: a tl;dr is available at the bottom\nPNG Structure\nBefore I dive into the vulnerability I'll talk a little bit about the structure of PNG files. PNGs are comprised of the header and chunks with chunks starting at offset 0x8 in the file. Each chunk contains the chunk type (a 4-character ASCII string), some data, and a CRC32 of that data.\nThe chunk structure can be represented as the following Go struct:\ntype Chunk struct {\n\tLength uint32\n\tType   [4]byte\n\tData   []byte\n\tCRC    uint32\n}\n\nThe PNG specification defines 4 \"critical\" chunk types and 14 \"ancillary\" chunk types for a total of 18 formally defined types which you can find here. Any chunks not specified here are considered unknown chunks that can be handled by the decoder.\nThe vulnerability\nInspecting the crash log of the application makes it pretty obvious that we have a null pointer dereference:\nException Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)\nException Subtype: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0000000000000000\nTriggered by Thread:  0\n\nThe stack trace tells us a little more though:\nThread 0 name:  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread\nThread 0 Crashed:\n0       ImageIO                       \t0x18699a618 0x186994000 + 0x6618\t// read_user_chunk_callback + 0x13c\n1       ImageIO                       \t0x18699a610 0x186994000 + 0x6610\t// read_user_chunk_callback + 0x134\n2       ImageIO                       \t0x18699a328 0x186994000 + 0x6328\t// png_handle_unknown + 0x44\n3       ImageIO                       \t0x18699961c 0x186994000 + 0x561c\t// _cg_png_read_info + 0x11c\n4       ImageIO                       \t0x186997b38 0x186994000 + 0x3b38\t// initImagePng + 0x654\n5       ImageIO                       \t0x186996c98 0x186994000 + 0x2c98\t// makeImagePlus + 0x4e4\n6       ImageIO                       \t0x186996240 0x186994000 + 0x2240\t// CGImageSourceCreateImageAtIndex + 0xb8\n7       UIKit                         \t0x18ad473d8 0x18abe0000 + 0x1673d8\t// _UIImageRefFromData + 0x1a8\n8       UIKit                         \t0x18aed2ff8 0x18abe0000 + 0x2f2ff8\t// -[UIImage(UIImagePrivate) _initWithData:preserveScale:cache:] + 0x78\n9       UIKit                         \t0x18ad471fc 0x18abe0000 + 0x1671fc\t// +[UIImage imageWithData:] + 0x48\n\nread_user_chunk_callback is where the crash occurs. A quick Google search for this and png_handle_unknown yields some results in libpng. Some more digging around the source code lead me to conclude that Apple uses libpng under the hood for the PNG files and the crashing image has an unknown (non-standard) chunk that's related to the crash. png_handle_unknown will, if PNG_READ_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED is enabled, call a user function callback for the application to handle the chunk. So read_user_chunk_callback is the name of Apple's custom chunk handler.\nA quick diff between the input file and crasher revealed that the input file had a chunk with data size of 0. What's happening here is:\n\nlibpng which is compiled to read unknow chunks hits an unknown chunk\nImageIO has an unknown chunk callback setup\nSince the size of the chunk data is 0, libpng gives the callback a null data chunk pointer\nThe data section is used without first checking the size of the value of the pointer\n\nEarlier I mentioned that the image I grabbed was some random screenshot I had sitting on my desktop. It turns out that screenshots taken on OS X include a custom iDOT chunk which contain some additional 28 bytes of data. The structure for the\nscreenshots I took were of form:\nnum_entries uint32 (usually 0x00000002)\nunk1        uint32 (usually 0x00000000)\nwidth       uint32\nunk2        uint32 (usually 0x00000028)\nwidth       uint32\nwidth       uint32\nunk3        uint32\n\n(Yes, the width appears to be repeated 3 times)\nI couldn't figure out what the unknown data is and wasn't too motivated to reverse engineer the rest of the function so if anyone reading this has any ideas, please ping me on Twitter (@landaire).\nThis was the offending chunk which is handled by this callback. Taking any screenshot and setting the size of the iDOT chunk to 0 is enough to trigger the bug.\nImpact\nThis bug can be triggered any time a PNG file is being processed. So really, anything that processes the image can be caused to crash. Some examples:\n\nReceiving the malicious image via text message with message previews turned on will crash SpringBoard on iOS\nEntering a message thread containing the image will crash the messages app\nOpening an email containing the image will crash the mail client\nPosting a link to the image will crash some third-party Twitter clients which try to load the image (Tweetbot for example)\nVisiting a page containing the image will crash Safari's content renderer\n\nAffected versions\nThe only devices I had available at the time were an iPad on iOS 7.1, my iPhone on iOS 9.0.2, and my Mac on OS X 10.11.2. All of these devices were vulnerable. It's reasonable to assume that this bug goes back quite far.\niOSOS X\nMinimum tested version7.110.11.1\nFixed version9.3.210.11.5\n\nOther findings\nIn exploring this bug I thought it was useful to test out various applications to see how they would handle this type of invalid image. Since the chunks all contain a CRC32 of the data, you cannot modify the image outright and then upload it to\nalmost any service. Twitter and imgur were two hosts I tried and they both would not accept the image because of the invalid CRC32. I wrote a simple Go utility that iterates the chunks and fixes any\ninvalid CRCs.\nAfter fixing the chunk both hosts accepted the image just fine. imgur (and likely most other hosts) do not bother to strip unknown chunks so uploading the image to imgur puts those users at risk. Twitter and Facebook on the other hand will re-encode any image as\na JPEG which will obviously remove the malicious chunk.\nI think that this is interesting and really important for privacy-concerned people. Before investigating this bug I had not considered additional chunks not being stripped when uploading an image to services. It makes sense, but it seems like this\nwould be an easy way for vendors to hide additional info about the device which took the image outside of the EXIF-related chunks and have them survive re-encoding.\nTimeline\n\nDec 16, 2015: Reported vulnerability to vendor\nDec 17, 2015: Vendor acknowledged vulnerability\nDec 27, 2015: Posted pic to Twitter to see what would happen\nDec 27, 2015: Vendor said the bug was undergoing triage\nMar 21, 2016 (91 days since disclosure): iOS 9.3 released and bug still not fixed, status update requested\nMar 22, 2016: Vendor notified me that a fix is \"in progress\"\nApril 22, 2016: Public disclosure\nMay 16, 2016: iOS 9.3.2 and macOS 10.11.5 were released, giving this vulnerability CVE-2016-1811\n\nIf you'd like to have a sample image, you can find it here.

On most sane systems there is no problem, but\nin the event that something goes wrong the SecureRandom::nextBytes() falls\nback to a custom random number generator which creates insecure random numbers.\nDetails\nThe nextBytes() function has three methods of RNG:\n\nIf the PHP 7 random_bytes()\nfunction exists, that is used.\nIf OpenSSL is installed on the system then openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()\nis used and the result is checked to ensure RNG succeeded.\nIf all of the above fail, a custom scheme is used. This is where the problem\nlies.\n\nThe custom scheme can take in a seed file which doesn't necessarily need to exist.\nIf the file does exist then the inital RNG seed is read from that file, otherwise\nthe seed is initialized with uniqid(mt_rand(), true).\nHere is where the random number is generated:\n$bytes = '';\nwhile (strlen($bytes) &lt; $nbBytes) {\n    static $incr = 1;\n    $bytes .= hash('sha512', $incr++.$this-&gt;seed.uniqid(mt_rand(), true).$nbBytes, true);\n    $this-&gt;seed = base64_encode(hash('sha512', $this-&gt;seed.$bytes.$nbBytes, true));\n    $this-&gt;updateSeed();\n}\n\n\nreturn substr($bytes, 0, $nbBytes);\n\nUpon inspection we can see the bytes that are eventually returned to the user\nare generated from a SHA-512 hash. This is probably done to make the output look uniform.\nA red flag is raised that maybe whatever is being fed to hash() isn't uniformly\nrandom. What's actually being fed to the core of this algorithm is the concatenation\nof some counter, seed, and a uniqid(). Let's take a look at each of these individually:\n\n\nThe counter starts out at 1 and is declared static. Since PHP is stateless,\nthe counter is predictable if you know how many times the function has been\ncalled for your request.\n\n\nmt_rand() is used as the $prefix to uniqid(). The PHP documentation\nfor both of these functions explicitly state that they should not be used for\ncryptographic purposes. uniqid() inparticular isn't meant to even be random -- just unique.\nAt its core it's just a concatenation of prefix, seconds, microseconds, and php_combined_lgc() (the latter explained here).\n\n\nThe seed can be something we don't know if the file already exists. There\nare two cases where we can predict the seed though:\n\nIf the user provides a path that doesn't exist\nIf the user provides a path to a file that the application does not\nhave permission to read or write.\n\n\n\n(Sidenote: Hugo's markdown generator doesn't support ordered vs unordered lists... what?)\nPoint #2 is kind of interesting here because both failure to read or write the\nfile fail silently and because PHP isn't exactly a type-safe language, nothing explodes.\nreadSeed():\nprivate function readSeed()\n{\n    return json_decode(file_get_contents($this-&gt;seedFile));\n}\n\nIf file_get_contents() fails it returns FALSE and is passed to json_decode().\nIf json_decode() fails, it simply returns NULL and you have to manually check\njson_last_error() to see why it failed. So if the file can't be read, your\nseed is null.\nupdateSeed() fails very similarly. The result of file_put_contents()\nis never checked and will fail silently.\ntl;dr\nSecureRandom::nextBytes() will generate insecure random numbers if you're not\nusing PHP 7, don't have random_compat, and OpenSSL fails for some reason.\nEven if this isn't a very practical or exploitable bug, it shows how a weakness\nat the core of a framework can go indiscovered for so long (this one almost 3 years!).\nI also mainly did this writeup to note that this is my first of hopefully many\nmore CVEs.\nTimeline:\n\nDec 14, 2015: Vulnerability identified and reported\nDec 30, 2015: No response, requested follow-up\nJan 14, 2016: Patch released for 2.3, 2.6, 2.7\nJan 18, 2016: Security advisory published\n\n","id":"https://landaire.net/cve-2016-1902/","title":"CVE-2016-1902: Symfony SecureRandom"},"https://landaire.net/one-weird-asan-trick/":{"body":"ASAN Primer\nIf you're already an ASAN expert, feel free to skip to the next section.\nAddressSanitizer (ASAN) is an extremely useful tool in software testing, debugging, and security testing for finding memory safety issues in native applications. It's extremely straightforward to use on most platforms -- all you need to do is pass -fsanitize=address to clang/gcc and run the application.\nAs your application runs it builds metadata about its memory state into what's called a shadow memory. The shadow memory is essentiallly a compressed representation of the application's address space and is used to look up memory ranges that are considered addressable. Memory ranges that are not addressable will be referred to as \"poisoned memory\".\nWhen ASAN detects a memory safety issue it will print a report to the console and stop the application.

The runtime library provides some of the following:\n\nMemory management hooks for malloc(), free(), operator new(), etc. Whenever a memory allocation/free occurs ASAN will update its shadow memory\nFunctions for checking if memory is addressable or poisoned.\nHooks for some common memory manipulation functions (strncpy, strcpy, memcpy, memcmp, etc.).\n\nFor checking if memory is addressable, ASAN's runtime provides some simple APIs that are used by its compiler instrumentation such as:\n\n__asan_load1\n__asan_store1\n__asan_load2\n__asan_store2\n__asan_load8\n__asan_store8\n...\n__asan_loadN\n\nNote: This is certainly not a definitive list of APIs, but are relatively common.\nThese all essentially do the same thing under the hood:\nextern \"C\" NOINLINE INTERFACE_ATTRIBUTE void __asan_exp_loadN(uptr addr, uptr size,\nu32 exp) {\n\n    if (__asan_region_is_poisoned(addr, size)) {\n        GET_CALLER_PC_BP_SP;\n        ReportGenericError(pc, bp, sp, addr, false, size, exp, true, false);\n    }\n\n}\n\nThey take an address and size, check if memory in that range is poisoned, and reports a generic error if it is.\nCompiler Instrumentation\nThe compiler instrumentation is primarily used for poisoning stack memory and inserting calls into the runtime library for \"interesting\" loads/stores. Of course, not every load/store will be instrumented by ASAN as that'd be a bit too heavy weight and a lot of things can be determined to be \"safe\" statically in the compiler.\nI'm not a compiler expert and truthfully don't care to dive into the source code at this time to figure out how ASAN determines what an \"interesting\" load/store is. With that said, when one is encountered ASAN's compiler pass will insert calls to the __asan_{load,store}{size} runtime functions to check the operation.\nYou're Probably Missing Out-of-Bounds Accesses\nWith the crash course on ASAN out of the way, we can dive in to the main point of this blog post: you're probably missing OOBR/W in your applications if you're using C++/Rust/whatever language containers.\nThe Problem With Vectors\nHere is some example code that should raise an out-of-bounds access violation:\n#include &lt;vector&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\nint main() {\n    // Allocate a vector to store some data generated by our fuzzer\n    std::vector&lt;char&gt; fuzzed;\n    // Fuzzer pushes 5 bytes to the vector\n    fuzzed.push_back(0x41);\n    fuzzed.push_back(0x42);\n    fuzzed.push_back(0x43);\n    fuzzed.push_back(0x44);\n    fuzzed.push_back(0x45);\n\n    // Copy 8 bytes from the vector to a test buffer\n    char test[8] = {0};\n    memcpy(&amp;test, fuzzed.data(), sizeof(test));\n    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; sizeof(test); i++) {\n        printf(\"%02X\", test[i]);\n    }\n\n    printf(\"\\nsize(%zu), capacity(%zu)\\n\", fuzzed.size(), fuzzed.capacity());\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWe have a vector with 5 bytes that we then try to copy 8 bytes from. Pretty standard out-of-bounds read. When we run this with ASAN however...\nProgram returned: 0\nProgram stdout\n\n4142434445FFFFFFBEFFFFFFBEFFFFFFBE\nsize(5), capacity(8)\n\nhttps://godbolt.org/z/cecf6Pjz8\nNo crash! You might notice something interesting in the last line of the output though: the size of the vector is 5, but its capacity is 8.\nSome readers probably know that when you push_back() or insert data into a vector that's at its capacity, it reallocates the buffer to be double its current size, copies the data to the new buffer, and frees the old one (or just does a realloc()). As a vector starts to grow from 0 elements up to N, its growth looks like the following:\n\nSource\nThis is very problematic for us. We're not catching an out-of-bounds access because of some implementation detail. All ASAN knows is that the application requested a buffer with 8 bytes -- it doesn't know that in our case 3 of those bytes are unused memory that aren't safe for us to use yet.\nIn the general case, any memory accesses in the range from [vector.data() + vector.size(), vector.data() + vector.capacity()] won't be detected as an out-of-bounds access!\nThe Problem With Strings\nHere's an example that's basically the same as the vector example above -- except, we're now constructing an std::string with a static C string.\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\nint main() {\n    std::string test(\"four\");\n    char temp[10] = {0};\n    memcpy(&amp;temp, test.data(), sizeof(temp));\n\n    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; sizeof(temp); i++) {\n        printf(\"%02X\", temp[i]);\n    }\n\n    printf(\"\\nsize(%lu), capacity(%lu)\\n\", test.size(), test.capacity());\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nAgain, this doesn't trigger a crash:\nProgram returned: 0\nProgram stdout\n\n666F7572000000000000\nsize(4), capacity(15)\n\nhttps://godbolt.org/z/hdjK1WoKo\nSo the four-character string actually has a total capacity of 15, i.e. the std::string has over-allocated memory. If you tried initializing an std::vector with an explicit initializer list it would allocate only the exact number of elements needed... why are strings different?\nLet's take a look at LLVM's libc++ string code (simplified version will follow):\n#ifdef _LIBCPP_BIG_ENDIAN\n    static const size_type __short_mask = 0x01;\n    static const size_type __long_mask  = 0x1ul;\n#else  // _LIBCPP_BIG_ENDIAN\n    static const size_type __short_mask = 0x80;\n    static const size_type __long_mask  = ~(size_type(~0) &gt;&gt; 1);\n#endif // _LIBCPP_BIG_ENDIAN\n\n    enum {__min_cap = (sizeof(__long) - 1)/sizeof(value_type) &gt; 2 ?\n                      (sizeof(__long) - 1)/sizeof(value_type) : 2};\n\n    struct __short\n    {\n        value_type __data_[__min_cap];\n        struct\n            : __padding&lt;value_type&gt;\n        {\n            unsigned char __size_;\n        };\n    };\n\n#else\n\n    struct __long\n    {\n        size_type __cap_;\n        size_type __size_;\n        pointer   __data_;\n    };\n\n#ifdef _LIBCPP_BIG_ENDIAN\n    static const size_type __short_mask = 0x80;\n    static const size_type __long_mask  = ~(size_type(~0) &gt;&gt; 1);\n#else  // _LIBCPP_BIG_ENDIAN\n    static const size_type __short_mask = 0x01;\n    static const size_type __long_mask  = 0x1ul;\n#endif // _LIBCPP_BIG_ENDIAN\n\n    enum {__min_cap = (sizeof(__long) - 1)/sizeof(value_type) &gt; 2 ?\n                      (sizeof(__long) - 1)/sizeof(value_type) : 2};\n\n    struct __short\n    {\n        union\n        {\n            unsigned char __size_;\n            value_type __lx;\n        };\n        value_type __data_[__min_cap];\n    };\n\n#endif // _LIBCPP_ABI_ALTERNATE_STRING_LAYOUT\n\n    union __ulx{__long __lx; __short __lxx;};\n\n    enum {__n_words = sizeof(__ulx) / sizeof(size_type)};\n\n    struct __raw\n    {\n        size_type __words[__n_words];\n    };\n\n    struct __rep\n    {\n        union\n        {\n            __long  __l;\n            __short __s;\n            __raw   __r;\n        };\n    };\n\n    __compressed_pair&lt;__rep, allocator_type&gt; __r_;\n\nGitHub link.\nYuck. This is not simple to understand, but we can see that there's some interesting inline buffer stuff going on with the __short struct at least. I've rewritten this code to be definitely not the same layout as an std::string but shows what's going on easier to understand:\nclass string {\n\tchar short_optimization[15];\n\tsize_t len;\n\tsize_t capacity;\n\tchar *heap_longer_string;\n}\n\nstd::string has an optimization for short strings that allows it to avoid a heap allocation. Unfortunately, this means that for small strings we won't detect small out-of-bounds reads (OOBR) similar to the std::vector problem. And similar to the std::vector problem, heap-allocated strings grow in a way that over-allocates memory to reduce the number of allocations every time you push more data to it.\nFixes\nThe \"One Weird Trick\"\nThis isn't really documented anywhere, but std::vector actually does have ASAN enlightenment to detect this exact problem we're talking about:\n    // The following functions are no-ops outside of AddressSanitizer mode.\n    // We call annotatations only for the default Allocator because other allocators\n    // may not meet the AddressSanitizer alignment constraints.\n    // See the documentation for __sanitizer_annotate_contiguous_container for more details.\n#ifndef _LIBCPP_HAS_NO_ASAN\n    _LIBCPP_CONSTEXPR_SINCE_CXX20\n    void __annotate_contiguous_container(const void *__beg, const void *__end,\n                                         const void *__old_mid,\n                                         const void *__new_mid) const\n    {\n\n      if (!__libcpp_is_constant_evaluated() &amp;&amp; __beg &amp;&amp; is_same&lt;allocator_type, __default_allocator_type&gt;::value)\n        __sanitizer_annotate_contiguous_container(__beg, __end, __old_mid, __new_mid);\n    }\n#else\n    _LIBCPP_CONSTEXPR_SINCE_CXX20 _LIBCPP_HIDE_FROM_ABI\n    void __annotate_contiguous_container(const void*, const void*, const void*,\n                                         const void*) const _NOEXCEPT {}\n#endif\n\nGitHub Link.\nWhen the _LIBCPP_HAS_NO_ASAN preprocessor macro is not defined it has some logic for informing ASAN about the contiguous region of a vector as well as the contiguous region that's allocated but yet-unused. The preprocessor macro is only defined when:\n#    if !__has_feature(address_sanitizer)\n#      define _LIBCPP_HAS_NO_ASAN\n#    endif\n\nGitHub Link.\nSo why the hell aren't we getting this enlightenment? We never defined it ourselves.\nI don't even remember why I tried this, but it seems you need to explicitly pass -stdlib=libc++ and just like magic, it works. Our example for an std::vector will now detect the small OOBR with this flag:\n=================================================================\n==1==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x602000000075 at pc 0x5640917cd227 bp 0x7ffe3ad2ee30 sp 0x7ffe3ad2e600\nREAD of size 8 at 0x602000000075 thread T0\n    #0 0x5640917cd226 in __asan_memcpy /root/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_interceptors_memintrinsics.cpp:22:3\n    #1 0x56409180aa25 in main /app/example.cpp:17:5\n    #2 0x7f35ef2f1082 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x24082) (BuildId: 1878e6b475720c7c51969e69ab2d276fae6d1dee)\n    #3 0x56409174935d in _start (/app/output.s+0x2135d)\n\nhttps://godbolt.org/z/ao64GcT7f.\nThere are some downsides to this:\n\nstd::vector is the only container with this enlightenment. But it does automatically update the poisoned region whenever we insert, remove, or clear the elements which is very nice.\nOur std::string example still doesn't detect the OOBR with this compiler flag: https://godbolt.org/z/3bj6nnGxG.\nYou may not want to enable this if you have modules you cannot compile with this flag that may share an std::vector. The module that's not enlightened would not poison memory correctly, leading to false-positives. There may be ABI compatability issues as well.\n\nCode-Level Fix\nGoogle's ASAN wiki provides documentation for how to manually poison memory yourself using ASAN_POISON_MEMORY_REGION(addr, size) and ASAN_UNPOISON_MEMORY_REGION(addr, size). We can use this as follows:\n#if __has_feature(address_sanitizer) || defined(__SANITIZE_ADDRESS__)\n#include &lt;sanitizer/asan_interface.h&gt;\n#endif\n\nconst uint8_t *extra_start = fuzzed.data() + fuzzed.size();\nsize_t extra_len = fuzzed.capacity() - fuzzed.size();\n\n\n#if __has_feature(address_sanitizer) || defined(__SANITIZE_ADDRESS__)\nASAN_POISON_MEMORY_REGION(extra_start, extra_len);\n#endif\n\nOr if for some reason you don't want to pull in the ASAN interface you could just copy data to a vector with the appropriate pre-allocated size:\nstd::vector&lt;uint8_t&gt; copied;\ncopied.reserve(fuzzed.size());\nstd::copy(\n    fuzzed.begin(),\n    fuzzed.end(),\n    std::back_inserter(copied)\n);\nassert_eq(copied.capacity(), copied.size())\n\nCopying data sucks, but do what works for you. Note: avoid using std::vector::shrink_to_fit(). Per cppreference, \"It depends on the implementation whether the request is fulfilled.\"\nOther Tricks\nWhile I have your attention I wanted to call out some other things you can do to improve your ability to find bugs.\nFailfast\nIf you have an abstraction that's intended to safely handle memory, why wait for your test or fuzzing harness to find the bug? For example, in my opinion a span implementation should never be given an invalid memory range. We can enforce this at its constructor by checking if the provided memory region is poisoned and trigger a controlled crash:\n#include &lt;sanitizer/asan_interface.h&gt;\n\ntemplate&lt;typename T&gt;\nclass span&lt;T&gt; {\n    public:\n    span(T *data, size_t count) {\n\n        if (__asan_region_is_poisoned(static_cast&lt;void*&gt;(data), count * sizeof(T))) {\n            assert(false);\n        }\n\n    }\n}\n\nSanitizer Recovery\nWhenever you repro a bug with ASAN, try to remember to compile with -fsanitize-recover=address. This will essentially allow the application to recover and continue running when ASAN triggers a violation.\nIt may seem like a strange choice, but let's say you have a small out-of-bounds read that looks relatively boring. That bug may be hiding something much juicier that's triggered only when the OOBR occurs! -fsanitize-recover=address will allow the application to run until either a hard fault occurs or the application exits, but will still print any ASAN violation that occurs along the way.\nClosing Thoughts\nASAN is a very powerful tool, but has limitations on what it can provide you by default. When using abstractions that allocate memory for you, keep in mind that they may reduce ASAN's effectiveness. The examples shown here were exclusively C++ examples, but can be easily applied to other languages as well.\nRust, for example, has zero ASAN englightenment at the time of this blog post. That means unsafe { } code manually reading from a Vec&lt;T&gt;'s data pointer or passing the pointer across an FFI boundary may run into similar false-negatives. Ditto for the String type, OSString, etc.\n","id":"https://landaire.net/one-weird-asan-trick/","title":"One Weird Trick to Improve Bug Finding With ASAN"},"https://landaire.net/phpbb-3-1-7-security-update/":{"body":"The phpBB team released phpBB version 3.1.7-PL1\non Jan 11, 2016 which fixed a CSRF issue I found in the admin control panel BBCode\ncreation form. Since BBCode is basically whitelisted HTML created by admins this\nCSRF vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript\ninto forum posts.\nThis was my first time looking at phpBB and I was very happy with actually being\nable to find something with significant impact within a few hours.\nFinding a target\nA good starting point for understanding the features and flow of phpBB controllers\nwould be to look at something users would have access to with complex operations\ngoing on. ./phpbb/phpBB/posting.php is a decent starting point since this is the page\nusers hit when creating topics/posts. This controller should have permission checks,\nrecord creation, form submission, and maybe some HTML escaping. At the top of\nthe file we can see something interesting:\n// Grab only parameters needed here\n$post_id    = request_var('p', 0);\n$topic_id   = request_var('t', 0);\n$forum_id   = request_var('f', 0);\n$draft_id   = request_var('d', 0);\n$lastclick  = request_var('lastclick', 0);\n\n$preview    = (isset($_POST['preview'])) ? true : false;\n$save       = (isset($_POST['save'])) ? true : false;\n$load       = (isset($_POST['load'])) ? true : false;\n$confirm    = $request-&gt;is_set_post('confirm');\n$cancel     = (isset($_POST['cancel']) &amp;&amp; !isset($_POST['save'])) ? true : false;\n\nMostly all of the request variables used in this controller are defined a the top\nof the file, some of which are taken from this weird request_var() function\nwhich IntelliJ tells me is deprecated. This function is basically a wrapper for\n\\phpbb\\request\\request_interface::variable(). Looking at \\phpbb\\request\\request::variable()\nit can be seen that this method returns the  requested var from some associative array.\nThe array is the concatenation of the $_POST and $_GET global variables. For those of you\nnot familiar with PHP these are globals which contain the POST request\nand query vars (respectively). All of these variables are also trim()'d and\ntype casted to match the type of whatever the default value is.\nThis is a key bit of information: if we can find some place in a form where a\nPOST request is made we should also be able to make the request with a GET. Maybe\nwe should start looking for CSRF bugs?\nHow CSRF tokens work in phpBB\nDoing a simple find in file for \"form\" in IDEA I came across this line:\nif ($submit &amp;&amp; check_form_key('posting'))\n\nLooking into the check_form_key() function it's clear that this is the function\nto check the CSRF token (using === mind you)... but it's done manually. And\nfurther down the file:\nadd_form_key('posting');\n\nSo adding and checking the CSRF token is done manually. This smells like something\nthat can lead to errors!\nFinding CSRF bugs!\nLet's search the project for add_form_key() and check_form_key(). What we're\nlooking for is files that show up in the result for add_form_key() but not for\ncheck_form_key().\nThe following image is the result of the search for add_form_key() and check_form_key()\nrespectively, with the admin control panel includes folder expanded:\n\nThe greater number of check_form_key() calls to add_form_key() calls isn't\nreally concerning since you can check the form key as many times as you'd like.\nWhat we're looking for is places where a form key is added but not checked.\nWe can see there are two places where calls to check_form_key() are definitely missing:\n\nacp_bbcode.php\nacp_extensions.php\n\nacp_extensions.php isn't too interesting since that just lets admins toggle\nshowing unstable versions when checking extensions for updates, so the worse a\nCSRF vuln here does is allow an attacker to make an admin think their extensions\nare outdated.\nThe check in acp_bbcode.php is of interest though since, although the form\nis submitted via POST, the request_var() method is used to retrieve all form\nvariables. We should be able to create BBCode over GET with a CSRF token omitted!\nHere's a demonstration of this vulnerability:\n{{&lt; youtube 7NsUoE32cyQ &gt;}}\nNotes\nAlthough this vulnerability can lead to XSS, it's really not practical. By default\nphpBB enforces re-authentication when admins go to the ACP and gives the admin\na different admin CP session ID. The SID also needs to be present in both the cookie\nand query string by default.\nIn theory a timing attack is possible since session IDs are checked with the equals\noperator ($this-&gt;session_id !== $session_id) but this is also not very practical\nsince sessions are tied to IP, browser, and some other information but most importantly\ndoing it over the network isn't exactly easy.\nThe only way I see this being practical is if there's also an XSS vulnerability\non some admin page that would allow you to inject a script to get the\nadmin SID from document.location then perform the exploit.\nTimeline\n\nJuly 11, 2015: Reported vulnerability \nAugust 4, 2015: Received response from two different project members requesting\nmore information\nDecember 23, 2015: Followed-up with project members (never received notification\nof response and I sort of forgot about this bug)\nDecember 23, 2015: Vendor confirmed bug\nJanuary 11, 2016: Fix released\n\n","id":"https://landaire.net/phpbb-3-1-7-security-update/","title":"Finding a CSRF vulnerability in phpBB"},"https://landaire.net/reversing-yaesu-firmware-encryption/":{"body":"Background\nHam radios are a fun way of learning how the radio spectrum works, and more importantly: they're embedded devices that may run weird chips/firmware! I got curious how easy it'd be to hack my Yaesu FT-70D, so I started doing some research. The only existing resource I could find for Yaesu radios was someone who posted about custom firmware for their Yaesu FT1DR.\nThe Reddit poster mentioned that if you go through the firmware update process via USB, the radio exposes its Renesas H8SX microcontroller and can have its flash modified using the Renesas SDK. This was a great start and looked promising, but the SDK wasn't trivial to configure and I wasn't sure if it could even dump the firmware... so I didn't use it for very long.\nOther Avenues\nYaesu provides a Windows application on their website that can be used to update a radio's firmware over USB:\n\n\nThe zip contains the following files:\n1.2 MB  Wed Nov  8 14:34:38 2017  FT-70D_ver111(USA).exe\n682 KB  Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 2017  FT-70DR_DE_Firmware_Update_Information_ENG_1711-B.pdf\n8 MB  Mon Apr 23 00:00:00 2018  FT-70DR_DE_MAIN_Firmware_Ver_Up_Manual_ENG_1804-B.pdf\n3.2 MB  Fri Jan  6 17:54:44 2012  HMSEUSBDRIVER.exe\n160 KB  Sat Sep 17 15:14:16 2011  RComms.dll\n61 KB  Tue Oct 23 17:02:08 2012  RFP_USB_VB.dll\n1.7 MB  Fri Mar 29 11:54:02 2013  vcredist_x86.exe\n\nI'm going to assume that the file specific to the FT-70D, \"FT-70D_ver111(USA).exe\", will likely contain our firmware image. A PE file (.exe) can contain binary resources in the .rsrc section -- let's see what this file contains using XPEViewer:\n\n\nResources fit into one of many different resource types, but a firmware image would likely be put into a custom type. What's this last entry, \"23\"? Expanding that node we have a couple of interesting items:\n\n\nRES_START_DIALOG is a custom string the updater shows when preparing an update, so we're in the right area!\n\n\nRES_UPDATE_INFO looks like just binary data -- perhaps this is our firmware image? Unfortunately looking at the \"Strings\" tab in XPEViewer or running the strings utility over this data doesn't yield anything legible. The firmware image is likely encrypted.\nReverse Engineering the Binary\nLet's load the update utility into our disassembler of choice to figure out how the data is encrypted. I'll be using IDA Pro, but Ghidra (free!), radare2 (free!), or Binary Ninja are all great alternatives. Where possible in this article I'll try to show my rewritten code in C since it'll be a closer match to the decompiler and machine code output.\nA good starting point is the the string we saw above, RES_UPDATE_INFO. Windows applications load resources by calling one of the FindResource* APIs. FindResourceA has the following parameters:\n\nHMODULE, a handle to the module to look for the resource in.\nlpName, the resource name.\nlpType, the resource type.\n\nIn our disassembler we can find references to the RES_UPDATE_INFO string and look for calls to FindResourceA with this string as an argument in the lpName position.\n\n\nWe find a match in a function which happens to find/load all of these custom resources under type 23.\n\n\nWe know where the data is loaded by the application, so now we need to see how it's used. Doing static analysis from this point may be more work than it's worth if the data isn't operated on immediately. To speed things up I'm going to use a debugger's assistance. I used WinDbg's Time Travel Debugging to record an execution trace of the updater while it updates my radio. TTD is an invaluable tool and I'd highly recommend using it when possible. rr is an alternative for non-Windows platforms.\nThe decompiler output shows this function copies the RES_UPDATE_INFO resource to a dynamically allocated buffer. The qmemcpy() is inlined and represented by a rep movsd instruction in the disassembly, so we need to break at this instruction and examine the edi register's (destination address) value. I set a breakpoint by typing bp 0x406968 in the command window, allow the application to continue running, and when it breaks we can see the edi register value is 0x2be5020. We can now set a memory access breakpoint at this address using ba r4 0x2be5020 to break whenever this data is read.\nOur breakpoint is hit at 0x4047DC -- back to the disassembler. In IDA you can press G and enter this address to jump to it. We're finally at what looks like the data processing function:\n\n\nWe broke when dereferencing v2 and IDA has automatically named the variable it's being assigned to as Time. The Time variable is passed to another function which formats it as a string with %Y%m%d%H%M%S. Let's clean up the variables to reflect what we know:\n1bool __thiscall sub_4047B0(char *this)\n2{\n3  char *encrypted_data; // esi\n4  BOOL v3; // ebx\n5  char *v4; // eax\n6  char *time_string; // [esp+Ch] [ebp-320h] BYREF\n7  int v7; // [esp+10h] [ebp-31Ch] BYREF\n8  __time64_t Time; // [esp+14h] [ebp-318h] BYREF\n9  int (__thiscall **v9)(void *, char); // [esp+1Ch] [ebp-310h]\n10  int v10; // [esp+328h] [ebp-4h]\n11\n12  // rename v2 to encrypted_data\n13  encrypted_data = *(char **)(*((_DWORD *)AfxGetModuleState() + 1) + 160);\n14  Time = *(int *)encrypted_data;\n15  // rename this function and its 2nd parameter\n16  format_timestamp(&amp;Time, (int)&amp;time_string, \"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\");\n17  v10 = 1;\n18  v7 = 0;\n19  v9 = off_4244A0;\n20  sub_4082C0(time_string);\n21  v3 = sub_408350(encrypted_data + 4, 0x100000, this + 92, 0x100000, &amp;v7) == 0;\n22  v4 = time_string - 16;\n23  v9 = off_4244A0;\n24  v10 = -1;\n25  if ( _InterlockedDecrement((volatile signed __int32 *)time_string - 1) &lt;= 0 )\n26    (*(void (__stdcall **)(char *))(**(_DWORD **)v4 + 4))(v4);\n27  return v3;\n28}\n\nThe timestamp string is passed to sub_4082c0 on line 20 and the remainder of the update image is passed to sub_408350 on line 21. I'm going to focus on sub_408350 since I only care about the firmware data right now and based on how this function is called I'd wager its signature is something like:\nstatus_t sub_408350(uint8_t *input, size_t input_len, uint8_t *output, output_len, size_t *out_data_processed);\n\nLet's see what it does:\n1int __stdcall sub_408350(char *a1, int a2, int a3, int a4, _DWORD *a5)\n2{\n3  int v5; // edx\n4  int v7; // ebp\n5  int v8; // esi\n6  unsigned int i; // ecx\n7  char v10; // al\n8  char *v11; // eax\n9  int v13; // [esp+10h] [ebp-54h]\n10  char v14[64]; // [esp+20h] [ebp-44h] BYREF\n11\n12  v5 = a2;\n13  v7 = 0;\n14  memset(v14, 0, sizeof(v14));\n15  if ( a2 &lt;= 0 )\n16  {\n17LABEL_13:\n18    *a5 = v7;\n19    return 0;\n20  }\n21  else\n22  {\n23    while ( 1 )\n24    {\n25      v8 = v5;\n26      if ( v5 &gt;= 8 )\n27        v8 = 8;\n28      v13 = v5 - v8;\n29      for ( i = 0; i &lt; 0x40; i += 8 )\n30      {\n31        v10 = *a1;\n32        v14[i] = (unsigned __int8)*a1 &gt;&gt; 7;\n33        v14[i + 1] = (v10 &amp; 0x40) != 0;\n34        v14[i + 2] = (v10 &amp; 0x20) != 0;\n35        v14[i + 3] = (v10 &amp; 0x10) != 0;\n36        v14[i + 4] = (v10 &amp; 8) != 0;\n37        v14[i + 5] = (v10 &amp; 4) != 0;\n38        v14[i + 6] = (v10 &amp; 2) != 0;\n39        v14[i + 7] = v10 &amp; 1;\n40        ++a1;\n41      }\n42      sub_407980(v14, 0);\n43      if ( v8 )\n44        break;\n45LABEL_12:\n46      if ( v13 &lt;= 0 )\n47        goto LABEL_13;\n48      v5 = v13;\n49    }\n50    v11 = &amp;v14[1];\n51    while ( 1 )\n52    {\n53      --v8;\n54      if ( v7 &gt;= a4 )\n55        return -101;\n56      *(_BYTE *)(a3 + v7++) = v11[6] | (2\n57                                      * (v11[5] | (2\n58                                                 * (v11[4] | (2\n59                                                            * (v11[3] | (2\n60                                                                       * (v11[2] | (2\n61                                                                                  * (v11[1] | (2\n62                                                                                             * (*v11 | (2 * *(v11 - 1))))))))))))));\n63      v11 += 8;\n64      if ( !v8 )\n65        goto LABEL_12;\n66    }\n67  }\n68}\n\nI think we've found our function that starts decrypting the firmware! To confirm, we want to see what the output parameter's data looks like before and after this function is called. I set a breakpoint in the debugger at the address where it's called (bp 0x404842) and put the value of the edi register (0x2d7507c) in WinDbg's memory window.\nHere's the data before:\n\n\nAfter stepping over the function call:\n\n\nWe can dump this data to a file using the following command:\n.writemem C:\\users\\lander\\documents\\maybe_deobfuscated.bin 0x2d7507c L100000\n\n010 Editor has a built-in strings utility (Search &gt; Find Strings...) and if we scroll down a bit in the results, we have real strings that appear in my radio!\n\n\nAt this point if we were just interested in getting the plaintext firmware we could stop messing with the binary and load the firmware into IDA Pro... but I want to know how this encryption works.\nEncryption Details\nJust to recap from the last section:\n\nWe've identified our data processing routine (let's call this function decrypt_update_info).\nWe know that the first 4 bytes of the update data are a Unix timestamp that's formatted as a string and used for an unknown purpose.\nWe know which function begins decrypting our firmware image.\n\nData Decryption\nLet's look at the firmware image decryption routine with some renamed variables:\n1int __thiscall decrypt_data(\n2        void *this,\n3        char *encrypted_data,\n4        int encrypted_data_len,\n5        char *output_data,\n6        int output_data_len,\n7        _DWORD *bytes_written)\n8{\n9  int data_len; // edx\n10  int output_index; // ebp\n11  int block_size; // esi\n12  unsigned int i; // ecx\n13  char encrypted_byte; // al\n14  char *idata; // eax\n15  int remaining_data; // [esp+10h] [ebp-54h]\n16  char inflated_data[64]; // [esp+20h] [ebp-44h] BYREF\n17\n18  data_len = encrypted_data_len;\n19  output_index = 0;\n20  memset(inflated_data, 0, sizeof(inflated_data));\n21  if ( encrypted_data_len &lt;= 0 )\n22  {\n23LABEL_13:\n24    *bytes_written = output_index;\n25    return 0;\n26  }\n27  else\n28  {\n29    while ( 1 )\n30    {\n31      block_size = data_len;\n32      if ( data_len &gt;= 8 )\n33        block_size = 8;\n34      remaining_data = data_len - block_size;\n35\n36      // inflate 1 byte of input data to 8 bytes of its bit representation\n37      for ( i = 0; i &lt; 0x40; i += 8 )\n38      {\n39        encrypted_byte = *encrypted_data;\n40        inflated_data[i] = (unsigned __int8)*encrypted_data &gt;&gt; 7;\n41        inflated_data[i + 1] = (encrypted_byte &amp; 0x40) != 0;\n42        inflated_data[i + 2] = (encrypted_byte &amp; 0x20) != 0;\n43        inflated_data[i + 3] = (encrypted_byte &amp; 0x10) != 0;\n44        inflated_data[i + 4] = (encrypted_byte &amp; 8) != 0;\n45        inflated_data[i + 5] = (encrypted_byte &amp; 4) != 0;\n46        inflated_data[i + 6] = (encrypted_byte &amp; 2) != 0;\n47        inflated_data[i + 7] = encrypted_byte &amp; 1;\n48        ++encrypted_data;\n49      }\n50      // do something with the inflated data\n51      sub_407980(this, inflated_data, 0);\n52      if ( block_size )\n53        break;\n54LABEL_12:\n55      if ( remaining_data &lt;= 0 )\n56        goto LABEL_13;\n57      data_len = remaining_data;\n58    }\n59    // deflate the data back to bytes\n60    idata = &amp;inflated_data[1];\n61    while ( 1 )\n62    {\n63      --block_size;\n64      if ( output_index &gt;= output_data_len )\n65        return -101;\n66      output_data[output_index++] = idata[6] | (2\n67                                              * (idata[5] | (2\n68                                                           * (idata[4] | (2\n69                                                                        * (idata[3] | (2\n70                                                                                     * (idata[2] | (2\n71                                                                                                  * (idata[1] | (2 * (*idata | (2 * *(idata - 1))))))))))))));\n72      idata += 8;\n73      if ( !block_size )\n74        goto LABEL_12;\n75    }\n76  }\n77}\n\nAt a high level this routine:\n\nAllocates a 64-byte scratch buffer\nChecks if there's any data to process.

If we take the bytes 0xAA and 0x77 which have bit representations of 0b1010_1010 and 0b0111_1111 respectively and inflate them to a 16-byte array using the algorithm above, we end up with:\n| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |    | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |    | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n\nThis routine does this process over 8 bytes at a time and completely fills the 64-byte scratch buffer with 1s and 0s just like the table above.\nNow let's look at step #4 and see what's going on in sub_407980:\n1_BYTE *__thiscall sub_407980(void *this, _BYTE *a2, int a3)\n2{\n3  // long list of stack vars removed for clarity\n4\n5  v3 = (int)this;\n6  v4 = 15;\n7  v5 = a3;\n8  v32[0] = (int)this;\n9  v28 = 0;\n10  v31 = 15;\n11  do\n12  {\n13    for ( i = 0; i &lt; 48; *((_BYTE *)&amp;v33 + i + 3) = v18 )\n14    {\n15      v7 = v28;\n16      if ( !v5 )\n17        v7 = v4;\n18      v8 = *(_BYTE *)(i + 48 * v7 + v3 + 4) ^ a2[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E50[i] + 31];\n19      v9 = v28;\n20      *(&amp;v34 + i) = v8;\n21      if ( !v5 )\n22        v9 = v4;\n23      v10 = *(_BYTE *)(i + 48 * v9 + v3 + 5) ^ a2[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E51[i] + 31];\n24      v11 = v28;\n25      *(&amp;v35 + i) = v10;\n26      if ( !v5 )\n27        v11 = v4;\n28      v12 = *(_BYTE *)(i + 48 * v11 + v3 + 6) ^ a2[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E52[i] + 31];\n29      v13 = v28;\n30      *(&amp;v36 + i) = v12;\n31      if ( !v5 )\n32        v13 = v4;\n33      v14 = *(_BYTE *)(i + 48 * v13 + v3 + 7) ^ a2[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E53[i] + 31];\n34      v15 = v28;\n35      v38[i -

This is substantially more complicated but looks like the meat of the decryption algorithm. We'll refer to this function, sub_407980, as decrypt_data from here on out. We can see what may be an immediate roadblock: this function takes in a C++ this pointer (line 5) and performs bitwise operations on one of its members (line 18, 23, etc.). For now let's call this class member key and come back to it later.\nThis function is the perfect example of decompilers emitting less than ideal code as a result of compiler optimizations/code reordering. For me, TTD was essential for following how data flows through this function. It took a few hours of banging my head against IDA and WinDbg to understand, but this function can be broken up into 3 high-level phases:\n\nBuilding a 48-byte buffer containing our key material XOR'd with data from a static table.\n\n1  int v33;\n2  unsigned __int8 v34; // [esp+44h] [ebp-34h]\n3  unsigned __int8 v35; // [esp+45h] [ebp-33h]\n4  unsigned __int8 v36; // [esp+46h] [ebp-32h]\n5  unsigned __int8 v37; // [esp+47h] [ebp-31h]\n6  char v38[44]; // [esp+48h] [ebp-30h]\n7\n8  v3 = (int)this;\n9  v4 = 15;\n10  v5 = a3;\n11  v32[0] = (int)this;\n12  v28 = 0;\n13  v31 = 15;\n14  do\n15  {\n16    // The end statement of this loop is strange -- it's writing a byte somewhere? come back\n17    // to this later\n18    for ( i = 0; i &lt; 48; *((_BYTE *)&amp;v33 + i + 3) = v18 )\n19    {\n20    // v28 Starts at 0 but is incremented by 1 during each iteration of the outer `while` loop\n21      v7 = v28;\n22      // v5 is our last argument which was 0\n23      if ( !v5 )\n24        // overwrite v7 with v4, which begins at 15 but is decremented by 1 during each iteration\n25        // of the outer `while` loop\n26        v7 = v4;\n27      // left-hand side of the xor, *(_BYTE *)(i + 48 * v7 + v3 + 4)\n28      //     v3 in this context is our `this` pointer + 4, giving us *(_BYTE *)(i + (48 * v7) + this-&gt;maybe_key)\n29      //     so the left-hand side of the xor is likely indexing into our key material:\n30      //     this-&gt;maybe_key[i + 48 * loop_multiplier]\n31      //\n32      // right-hand side of the xor, a2[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E50[i] + 31]\n33      //     a2 is our input encrypted data, and byte_424E50 is some static data\n34      //\n35      // this full statement can be rewritten as:\n36      //     v8 = this-&gt;maybe_key[i + 48 * loop_multiplier] ^ encrypted_data[byte_424E50[i] + 31]\n37      v8 = *(_BYTE *)(i + 48 * v7 + v3 + 4) ^ a2[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E50[i] + 31];\n38\n39      v9 = v28;\n40\n41      // write the result of `key_data ^ input_data` to a scratch buffer (v34)\n42      // v34 looks to be declared as the wrong type. v33 is actually a 52-byte buffer\n43      *(&amp;v34 + i) = v8;\n44\n45      // repeat the above 5 more times\n46      if ( !v5 )\n47        v9 = v4;\n48      v10 = *(_BYTE *)(i + 48 * v9 + v3 + 5) ^ a2[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E51[i] + 31];\n49      v11 = v28;\n50      *(&amp;v35 + i) = v10;\n51\n52      // snip\n53\n54      // v18 gets written to the scratch buffer at the end of the loop...\n55      v18 = *(_BYTE *)(i + 48 * v17 + v3 + 9) ^ a2[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E55[i] + 31];\n56\n57      // this was probably the *real* last statement of the for-loop\n58      // i.e. for (int i = 0; i &lt; 48; i += 6)\n59      i += 6;\n60    }\n\n\nBuild a 32-byte buffer containing data from an 0x800-byte static table, with indexes into this table originating from indices built from the buffer in step #1.

My approach here is to set a breakpoint at the first instruction to use the key data in decrypt_data, which happens to be xor bl, [ecx + esi + 4] at 0x4079d3. I know this is where we should break because in the decompiler output the left-hand side of the XOR operation, the key material, will be the second operand in the xor instruction. As a reminder, the decompiler shows the XOR as:\nv8 = *(_BYTE *)(i + 48 * v7 + v3 + 4) ^ a2[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E50[i] + 31];\n\nThe breakpoint is hit and the address we're loading from is 0x19f5c4. We can now lean on TTD to help us figure out where this data was last written. Set a 1-byte memory write breakpoint at this address using ba w1 0x19f5c4 and press the Go Back button. If you've never used TTD before, this operates exactly as Go would except backwards in the program's trace. In this case it will execute backward until either a breakpoint is hit, interrupt is generated, or we reach the start of the program.\nOur memory write breakpoint gets triggered at 0x4078fb -- a function we haven't seen before. The callstack shows that it's called not terribly far from the decrypt_update_info routine!\n\nset_key (we are here -- function is originally called sub_407850)\nsub_4082c0\ndecrypt_update_info\n\nWhat's sub_4082c0?\n\n\nNot a lot to see here except the same function called 4 times, initially with the timestamp string as an argument in position 0, a 64-byte buffer, and bunch of function calls using the return value of the last as its input. The function our debugger just broke into takes only 1 argument, which is the 64-byte buffer used across all of these function calls. So what's going on in sub_407e80?\n\n\nThe bitwise operations that look supsiciously similar to the byte to bit inflation we saw above with the firmware data. After renaming things and performing some loop unrolling, things look like this:\n1// sub_407850\n2int inflate_timestamp(void *this, char *timestamp_str, char *output, uint8_t *key) {\n3    for (size_t output_idx = 0; output_idx &lt; 8; output_idx++) {\n4        uint8_t ts_byte = *timestamp_str;\n5        if (ts_byte) {\n6            timestamp_str += 1;\n7        }\n8\n9        for (int bit_idx = 0; bit_idx &lt; 8; bit_idx++) {\n10            uint8_t bit_value = (ts_byte &gt;&gt; (7 - bit_idx)) &amp; 1;\n11            output[(output_idx * 8) + bit_idx] ^= bit_value;\n12        }\n13    }\n14\n15    set_key(this, key);\n16    decrypt_data(this, output, 1);\n17\n18    return timestamp_str;\n19}\n20\n21// sub_4082c0\n22int set_key_to_timestamp(void *this, char *timestamp_str) {\n23    uint8_t key_buf[64];\n24    memset(&amp;key_buf, 0, sizeof(key_buf));\n25\n26    char *str_ptr = inflate_timestamp(this, timestamp_str, &amp;key_buf, &amp;static_key_1);\n27    str_ptr = inflate_timestamp(this, str_ptr, &amp;key_buf, &amp;static_key_2);\n28    str_ptr = inflate_timestamp(this, str_ptr, &amp;key_buf, &amp;static_key_3);\n29    inflate_timestamp(this, str_ptr, &amp;key_buf, &amp;static_key_4);\n30\n31    set_key(this, &amp;key_buf);\n32}\n\nThe only mystery now is the set_key routine:\n1int __thiscall set_key(char *this, const void *a2)\n2{\n3  _DWORD *v2; // ebp\n4  char *v3; // edx\n5  char v4; // al\n6  char v5; // al\n7  char v6; // al\n8  char v7; // al\n9  int result; // eax\n10  char v10[56]; // [esp+Ch] [ebp-3Ch] BYREF\n11\n12  qmemcpy(v10, a2, sizeof(v10));\n13  v2 = &amp;unk_424DE0;\n14  v3 = this + 5;\n15  do\n16  {\n17    v4 = v10[0];\n18    qmemcpy(v10, &amp;v10[1], 0x1Bu);\n19    v10[27] = v4;\n20    v5 = v10[28];\n21    qmemcpy(&amp;v10[28], &amp;v10[29], 0x1Bu);\n22    v10[55] = v5;\n23    if ( *v2 == 2 )\n24    {\n25      v6 = v10[0];\n26      qmemcpy(v10, &amp;v10[1], 0x1Bu);\n27      v10[27] = v6;\n28      v7 = v10[28];\n29      qmemcpy(&amp;v10[28], &amp;v10[29], 0x1Bu);\n30      v10[55] = v7;\n31    }\n32    for ( result = 0; result &lt; 48; result += 6 )\n33    {\n34      v3[result - 1] = v10[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E20[result] - 1];\n35      v3[result] = v10[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E21[result] - 1];\n36      v3[result + 1] = v10[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E22[result] - 1];\n37      v3[result + 2] = v10[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E23[result] - 1];\n38      v3[result + 3] = v10[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E24[result] - 1];\n39      v3[result + 4] = v10[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E25[result] - 1];\n40    }\n41    ++v2;\n42    v3 += 48;\n43  }\n44  while ( (int)v2 &lt; (int)byte_424E20 );\n45  return result;\n46}\n\nThis function is a bit more straightforward to reimplement:\n1void set_key(void *this, uint8_t *key) {\n2    uint8_t scrambled_key[56];\n3    memcpy(&amp;scrambled_key, key, sizeof(scrambled_key));\n4\n5    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; 16; i++) {\n6        size_t swap_rounds = 1;\n7        if (((uint32_t*)GLOBAL_KEY_ROUNDS_CONFIG)[i] == 2) {\n8            swap_rounds = 2;\n9        }\n10\n11        for (int i = 0; i &lt; swap_rounds; i++) {\n12            uint8_t temp = scrambled_key[0];\n13            memcpy(&amp;scrambled_key, &amp;scrambled_key[1], 27);\n14            scrambled_key[27] = temp;\n15\n16            temp = scrambled_key[28];\n17            memcpy(&amp;scrambled_key[28], &amp;scrambled_key[29], 27);\n18            scrambled_key[55] = temp;\n19        }\n20\n21        for (size_t swap_idx = 0; swap_idx &lt; 48; swap_idx++) {\n22            size_t scrambled_key_idx = GLOBAL_KEY_SWAP_TABLE[swap_idx] - 1;\n23\n24            size_t persistent_key_idx = swap_idx + (i * 48);\n25            this-&gt;key[persistent_key_idx] = scrambled_key[scrambled_key_idx];\n26        }\n27    }\n28}\n\nPutting Everything Together\n\nUpdate data is read from resources\nThe first 4 bytes of the update data are a Unix timestamp\nThe timestamp is formatted as a string, has each byte inflated to its bit representation, and decrypted using some static key material as the key. This is repeated 4 times with the output of the previous run used as an input to the next.\nThe resulting data from step 3 is used as a key for decrypting data.\nThe remainder of the firmware update image is inflated to its bit representation 8 bytes at a time and uses the dynamic key and 3 other unique static lookup tables to transform the inflated input data.\nThe result from step 5 is deflated back into its byte representation.\n\nMy decryption utility which completely reimplements this magic in Rust can be found at https://github.com/landaire/porkchop.\nLoading the Firmware in IDA Pro\nIDA thankfully supports disassembling the Hitachi/Rensas H8SX architecture. If we load our firmware into IDA and select the \"Hitachi H8SX advanced\" processsor type, use the default options for the \"Disassembly memory organization\" dialog, then finally choose \"H8S/2215R\" in the \"Choose the device name\" dialog...:\n\n\nWe don't have shit. I'm not an embedded systems expert, but my friend suggested that the first few DWORDs look like they may belong to a vector table. If we right-click address 0 and select \"Double word 0x142A\", we can click on the new variable unk_142A to go to its location. Press C at this location to define it as Code, then press P to create a function at this address:\n\n\nWe can now reverse engineer our firmware :)\n","id":"https://landaire.net/reversing-yaesu-firmware-encryption/","title":"Reverse Engineering Yaesu FT-70D Firmware Encryption"},"https://landaire.net/world-of-warships-deobfuscation/":{"body":"An in-depth analysis of how World of Warships obfuscates its game scripts and how to mostly deobfuscate them. The wowsdeob project can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/landaire/wowsdeob\nBackground\nThis blog post is something I'm writing 3 years after my initial research/development, and about 2 years after I stopped actively working on the tool. Some of the details in this blog may not be fully accurate from time slippage and a lot of the initial research notes I made were lost or scattered in Discord conversations.\nI am only now writing this as the game is somewhat dead and the development team chooses to continually release content that makes gameplay worse. Submarines, hybrid battleships, aircraft carriers, and HE-spamming battleships with cruiser concealment that overmatch everything have led to a less enjoyable gameplay experience.\nThe tool and techniques have been kept to a very tight circle so that data mining could continue without a potential cat-and-mouse game with the developer. I apologize to that community if that does occur.\nTwo years ago I open-sourced a tool I called unfuck which I described as a \"Python 2.7 bytecode deobfuscator unfucker\". That tool was the result of the work I had done for World of Warships, but isn't capable of completely deobfuscating World of Warships files out-of-the-box. unfuck made the rounds on HN where I got supportive responses such as:\n\nLook, I get that edgy names are fun, but I'm happy that I will never have to use this tool for work, and I pity the fool who has to explain why \"unfuck\" was needed to solve a real problem.\n\nAnd:\n\nOoof, really bad name. Makes me think the project or maintainer are immature...\n\nAnd someone respecting my licensing choices:\n\nInteresting dual licensing\n\n\n\nThis project is dual-licensed under MIT and the ABSE (\"Anyone But Stefan Esser\") license. Note that an additional exception to the license is added, forbidding use/redistribution of said content to his trainees as well, but only when in a 5 mile radius from \"Stefan Esser\" or while holding any sort of (video)conference/chat with him.\n\n\nNote that this license will only be used as long as what would capstone decode / that one other arm64 ida plugin thing by i0n1c (\"Stefan Esser\") are not under the MIT license. afterwards, all exceptions are cleared and basically MIT license applies\n\n\nWhat is World of Warships?\nWorld of Warships (WoWs) is a free-to-play naval warfare multiplayer game released in 2015 by Wargaming and their Lesta Studio. It supports multiple forms of modifications via Adobe Flash for UI mods, XML/audio files for audio mods, custom ship textures, and Python for basically everything else. The Python APIs are somewhat limited, but can observe some in-game events that allow mod developers to surface information that the game doesn't show you by default.\nUnlike a lot of multiplayer games, WoWs uses an authoritative server model where each client is only receiving events that the server believes they should receive. For example, enemy ship locations and related information is only pushed down to clients when they are intended to be painted to your screen. There are no wall hacks and things like auto-aim are somewhat negated by player skill. That doesn't mean there aren't illegal mods/cheats that show you where to aim, where incoming artillery shells will land, etc.\nWith all of that said, there is very little incentive to cheat in this game. A top-tier player in World of Warships will have the game sense and skill that comes within a close margin to someone playing with cheats. Therefore deobfuscation of scripts doesn't necessarily help with cheat development apart from illegal mods, but may help modders create better mods in general.\nGame Scripts\nAlthough the World of Warships developers are mostly transparent about how game mechanics work, there have still been some mysteries. For example, the algorithm for how the dispersion ellipse of your shells is calculated and the dispersion of the shells themselves.\nThe format of match replay files is also mostly documented through reverse engineering work of a few researchers and from reviewing publicly available engine source code, but there are still unknown elements to the serialized format. For these reasons it's highly desirable to review the implementation code to unmask these mysteries.\nThere has been at least one other individual who managed to deobfuscate and decompile the game scripts as far back as 2016. A World of Warships EU forum member by the name of \"TehRick\" / \"ThiSpawn\" made multiple posts showing they had reverse engineered some of the C++ and Python logic. In fact, they explicitly called out the \"Lesta anti-noob protection\" obfuscated Python module name in one of their forum posts:\n\nIn a Reddit post by the same username they also linked to a decompiled Python source file: https://pastebin.com/y3Yk43Nd.\nAlthough TehRick seems to have disappeared soon after these posts, their code was still being referenced 4 years later!\nIf you are TehRick / ThiSpawn feel free to reach out to me -- I would love to talk about your deobfuscator!\nPython VM Primer\nWhen Python source code is executed, you may notice that a .pyc file is created. The Python interpreter doesn't interpret raw source code -- it first compiles that source code to an intermediate representation that can be fed to the VM as instructions.\nThe VM is stack-based with some \"registers\" which are used for runtime storage of variables in pre-defined variable (or unnamed) slots. Almost every VM operation with the exception of loads/stores will directly modify values on the stack in some way. Variable registers cannot be modified in-place, and must first be put directly on the stack.\nEach object on the stack or in a variable slot is a deserialized Python object representing one of the following types:\n\nNone\nStopIteration\nEllipsis\nBool\nLong\nFloat\nComplex\nBytes\nString\nTuple\nList\nDict\nSet\nFrozenSet\nCode\n\nBasically the raw primitive types you're probably used to when writing Python. All module definitions, functions, etc. are defined as Code objects that live in the co_consts section of their parent code object. Ditto with any lists, tuples, etc. that are hard coded in source code.\nInstructions\nWorld of Warships uses Python 2.7 which has helpful documentation covering all instructions here: https://docs.python.org/2/library/dis.html.\nAll instructions are at least 1 byte for the opcode and up to 3 bytes for instructions which have a 16-bit argument. For example, a JUMP_ABSOLUTE 300 may be encoded as 0x71_012c and a POP_TOP may be encoded as 0x01.\nThe WoWs developers did not do any opcode remapping, which is a fairly common obfuscation trick when an application has the flexibility of embedding the Python VM.\nPrior Work on Deobfuscation\nlpcvoid's Findings\nWorld of Warships' core game logic is contained within a scripts.zip file that is handled by a special loader. The loader reads compiled Python (files ending in .pyc) out of this zip archive and even uses a special technique of handling the serialized Python code object.\nThis logic and deobfuscating the first stage of the matryoshka doll has already been described by lpcvoid on his blog and he even has a part 2 going into some of the junk instructions. I highly recommend reading his blog posts before continuing, as I will not rehash his hard work.\nTo summarize his findings: the module loader deserializes the bytecode object and uses the bytecode as an encryption key for some ciphertext stored in const data. After decrypting the ciphertext, the plaintext is decompressed (zlib) and is executed as a code object.\nRapid Analysis of Bytecode Using pyasm\nI wanted to take a quick moment to call out that my friend @gabe_k wrote a tool for a CTF challenge he put together many years ago called pyasm that is specifically designed for this type of scenario. It can gracefully handle disassembling of bad instructions, and even supports recompiling a .pyasm file back to a serialized code object. I've forked the project and made some quality of life improvements/bug fixes here: https://github.com/landaire/pyasm.\nHere is an example of what one of these .pyc files look like when converted to a .pyasm file (redacted since it's very long):\ncode\n\tstack_size 3\n\tflags 66\n\tconsts 4\n\t\tnone\n\t\tstring \"Wargaming.net | Lesta Studio\"\n\t\tstring \"an error occurred while loading module\"\n\t\tstring \"\\x9a\\xb6\\x85A.^lPGO0Z/\\xeeY3o\\x11$,FCPCi&amp;:U\\x04\\t\\x02IS\\x155EJ\\x1a3\\x96\\x1f=*\\xe2?\\xa95\\xa5\\tf\\x13hl\\x92,\\x12\\x14T\\x06\\xc8o:\\x08\\x16\\xd4\\xfd\\xd0\\x8c\\xc1T\\xa0\\x9b\\xe5b\\xc3%\\x0eD\\x8e\\x85\\xfb%\\x83\\x9b\\xffL\\rH\\ruk\\x14\\xf2=\\xd7\\x86\\t\\x13\\x0bk\\x83HL\\tH\\xbf\\x076IM\\xa1\\x0bTP\\xdc\\xc7&lt;\\n\\x08\\x8c\\xdd\\x05\\'\\x19\\xf0\\xa2FL\\t\\xbb\\xd7\\x15=\\xd8\\xc3\\xba3\\x19\\x0fk\\xd9\\xe4\\xf0\\xbf\\x9c?\\nTJP\\xc1\\xcc\\x17\\xce\\x04\\x18\\xfe98\\x0e\\x1d\\x86\\xdc\\xab\\x19\\xe6)M,\\x0e\\xd4\\xd8\\xd4\\x02\\xb1\\x0b(&amp;;(o_\\x1c\\x1b\\x16\\xd8\\xe1!-\\xadw\\xda%\\xd0/\\xa2\\x1a\\x08*7\\xc7\\x9d\\x107\\x0f\\xe4\\xcc\\x1c\\x0c)...\n\tend\n\tnames 1\n\t\tstring \"locals\"\n\tend\n\tinstructions\n\t\t&lt;255&gt; 65532\n\t\tUNARY_INVERT \n\t\tSETUP_EXCEPT 15\n\t\tLOAD_CONST 1 # Wargaming.net | Lesta Studio\n\t\tLOAD_NAME 0 # locals\n\t\tCALL_FUNCTION 0\n\t\tDUP_TOP \n\t\tEXEC_STMT\n\t\tPOP_BLOCK \n\t\tJUMP_FORWARD 12\n\t\t3 * POP_TOP\n\t\tLOAD_CONST 2 # an error occurred while loading module\n\t\tPRINT_ITEM \n\t\tPRINT_NEWLINE \n\t\tJUMP_FORWARD 1\n\t\tEND_FINALLY \n\t\tLOAD_CONST 0 # None\n\t\tRETURN_VALUE \n\t\tDELETE_NAME 23519\n\t\tUNARY_NOT\n\t\tDELETE_NAME 23438\n\t\t&lt;216&gt; 64603\n\t\tINPLACE_OR\n\t\tUNARY_NOT\n\t\tDELETE_NAME 23308\n...\nend\n\nThroughout my analysis of the obfuscation tricks I frequently leaned on pyasm for manually reordering/deleting instructions in order to figure out which sections were causing hiccups for the decompiler.\nWoWs - Generic Obfuscation Tricks\n1: Bogus Instructions\nAfter decrypting and decompressing the 2nd stage code object, you'll find that tools like uncompyle6 fail to decompile the bytecode to source with an error. In his 2nd blog post lpcvoid covered one of Lesta's tricks of inserting bogus instructions that contain completely invalid opcodes which confuse these types of tools. One thing not mentioned is that these instructions can also be valid but really mess up the VM's stack and cause static analysis to enter a bad state.\nUnfortunately, tools like uncompyle are mostly intended to run on Python bytecode generated cleanly by a Python VM. Invalid opcodes are definitely not supported, and neither are invalid instruction operands. This trick is the most straightforward for causing a decompiler to choke.\n2: Stack Reordering\nDifferent Python code patterns -- even if semantically the same -- have very slight nuance in the emitted instructions. Tools like uncompyle in some cases rely on fragile instruction patterns for mapping to source code and will easily encounter errors when a wonky pattern is encountered.\nThe following is a completely made-up example, but consider the following instruction sequence:\n              224  LOAD_CONST            0\n              227  MAKE_FUNCTION_0       0  None\n\n L. 351       230  STORE_FAST            6  'f333'\n\nThis loads some code object from the const section, makes a function, and stores that function in co_varnames[6]. This would typically result in something like the following Python code:\ndef f333():\n    pass\n\nNow imagine that the instructions were rewritten to push and immediately pop a value to the stack randomly in the middle of creating the function:\n              224  LOAD_CONST            0\n              227  MAKE_FUNCTION_0       0  None\n              ...  LOAD_CONST            None\n              ...  POP_TOP\n\n L. 351       230  STORE_FAST            6  'f333'\n\nThe LOAD_CONST/MAKE_FUNCTION/STORE_FAST pattern is broken by instructions that are effectively a no-op, and the signatures used by the decompilers are now broken.\n3: Const Predicates\nRelated to trick #2, instruction patterns may be broken by inserting conditions that evaluate to a constant value. One side of the branch may bring you to some garbage instructions (trick #1) and on the other side of the branch will be the next set of valid code to be executed.\nConsider the following pseudocode:\n              224  LOAD_CONST            0\n              227  MAKE_FUNCTION_0       0  None\n              if len({1, 2, 3} &amp; {2}) &gt; 0:\n L. 351       230  STORE_FAST            6  'f333'\n              else:\n              ...  POP_TOP\n              ...  POP_TOP\n              ...  POP_TOP\n              ...  RETURN_VALUE\n\n\nIn the middle of defining a function we've inserted a check to see if two sets overlap, and if so  we store the function in variable slot #6 (STORE_FAST 6). If the sets do not overlap, we go down the bogus code path that screws up stack state.\n4: Variable Renaming\nThis one really doesn't impact tools but definitely impacts any end user who manages to partially decompile anything: local variables and function names (in the serialized function object) are renamed to things that are illegal in Python source code such as keywords, operators, and a combination of these things with spaces. Function objects are typically renamed to be very large unique numbers. Here is a real example from when I first set on this project:\n\n            def f333(impf, f222):\n                continue r ; = 66\n                h &gt;&gt; ] = 87\n                assert } break = 538\n                l else try 6 = 199\n                continue r ; += 66\n                h &gt;&gt; ] -= 538\n                assert } break *= 199\n                if not continue r ; + h &gt;&gt; ] &gt;= assert } break - h &gt;&gt; ] + l else try 6:\n                    * k try 4 = 113\n                * k try 4 = None\n                2 c = 22\n                v as lambda n = 433\n                6 p = 147\n                * k try 4 += 113\n                2 c -= 433\n                v as lambda n *= 147\n                if not * k try 4 + 2 c &gt;= v as lambda n - 2 c + 6 p:\n                    pass\n                (j in, % /= p, 6 { +, y [, += import r) = ()\n\n5: Implicit Returns\nThe RETURN_VALUE instruction in Python returns the value located at the top of the VM's stack. Python will, as far as I'm aware, always emit a RETURN_VALUE with the immediately preceding instruction setting up the value to be returned. For example:\nLOAD_FAST 0\nRETURN_VALUE\n\nThis loads the value stored at co_varnames[0] to the top of stack and returns it. Splitting up these instructions will break the pattern decompilers use to transform this into return varname. Imagine if the in the following code tos literally represented the top of the stack (and not a variable slot):\nif condition:\n    tos = get_return_value()\nelse:\n    tos = other_return_value()\n\nreturn\n\nThis would create the following control flow:\n\nIn this scenario the instruction immediately preceding the RETURN_VALUE isn't the instruction setting up the value -- it's likely some type of JUMP instruction or quite possibly anything else!\nIt's not clear to me if this is more of a code optimization trick, or an obfuscation trick, but really what's the difference?\n6: Weird Jumps\nSomething else I noticed was that some jumps were just... weird? There were randomish-looking JUMP_FORWARD N instructions that didn't make sense (but usually were just jumping over garbage instructions), and were hard to disambiguate from those legitimately generated by the Python compiler. For example, the following Python code may insert a JUMP_FORWARD 0 (jump to the next instruction):\nif !foo: # POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE\n    # EMIT THIS CODE FIRST\n    if foo:\n        print \"target\"\n    else:\n        print \"else\"\n# AFTER THE ABOVE BLOCK IS EMITTED, INSERT JUMP_FORWARD 0\nelse:\n    # EMIT BLOCK\n    print \"main target\"\n\nThis probably doesn't make much sense, so let me show a real example of the control flow at an instruction level:\n\n\nDo you notice the JUMP_FORWARD 0 in the left-center node? It's completely unnecessary! The layout of these instructions when serialized is: POP_TOP, POP_TOP, POP_TOP, JUMP_FORWARD 0, LOAD_FAST 2. The execution sequence of these instructions is exactly the same as well. You could remove the JUMP_FORWARD 0 and nothing of value would be lost. So why is it there?\nIt's just a side effect of how the Python compiler does codegen:\ndef visitIf(self, node):\n    end = self.newBlock()\n    numtests = len(node.tests)\n    for i in range(numtests):\n        test, suite = node.tests[i]\n        if is_constant_false(test):\n            # XXX will need to check generator stuff here\n            continue\n        self.set_lineno(test)\n        self.visit(test)\n        nextTest = self.newBlock()\n        self.emit('POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE', nextTest)\n        self.nextBlock()\n        self.visit(suite)\n        self.emit('JUMP_FORWARD', end) # &lt;--- UNCONDITIONALLY ADD `JUMP_FORWARD`\n        self.startBlock(nextTest)\n    if node.else_:\n        self.visit(node.else_)\n    self.nextBlock(end)\n\nSometimes that JUMP_FORWARD isn't jumping 0 bytes and may be some value that jumps over garbage instructions (and was inserted by the obfuscator). Other times this JUMP_FORWARD comes immediately after some other unconditional control flow instruction and will never be executed by a Python VM (or picked up by my instruction decoder).\nSo why can't it be removed if it's usually unnecessary? Unfortunately uncompyle relies on the presence of the JUMP_FORWARD to determine what type of condition has occurred.\n7: Generally Weird Control Flow\nThis one is hard to express without sounding psychotic, but let me just say: fuck loops, fuck exception handlers. If you combine the weird jumps and false predicates in loops, you may be able to generate some code that looks like a loop but is only ever executed for one iteration before just jumping to some other part of the code because of a const predicate.\nAnd what about exception handlers that intentionally raise an exception that's supposed to be caught to trigger the \"good\" code path?\nAnd what about nesting exceptions inside of loops with const predicates?\nAfter encountering such a scenario I was starting to feel like this:\n\nDeobfuscation\nDeobfuscating everything together requires a solid framework that can achieve:\n\nParsing all instructions in a manner that doesn't break on bogus opcodes\nEvaluating conditions to determine used/unused code\nRestoring instruction ordering\nRestoring variable names\nDeoptimizing code (implicit returns)\nNormalize weird control flow\n\n...so yeah the natural path I took here was to rebuild the Python VM in Rust in 2 months and write somewhat spaghetti code that revisiting two years later has me thinking \"wtf was I smoking?\".\nAvoiding Bad Instructions\nParsing instructions is fairly straightforward: an instruction with no arguments is 1 byte (opcode), and an instruction with an argument is 3 bytes (opcode + uint16). You start parsing instructions by reading from offset 0 in the co_code section of the code object and just continue this in a loop.\nDecompilers and disassemblers tend to read instructions linearly -- i.e. if the first instruction is JUMP_ABSOLUTE 200 it's going to disassemble JUMP_ABSOLUTE 200 from offset 0, then disassemble the next instruction from offset 3. This isn't great because you will run into a bunch of bogus instructions that can be avoided by simply creating a decoder that understands control flow.\nTo mitigate this in my deobfuscator I instead add instruction offsets to a queue. A JUMP_ABSOLUTE 200 will add offset 200 as next in the queue, and a JUMP_IF_{TRUE,FALSE} &lt;TARGET&gt; will add the offset for the target and the next instruction to the queue.\nAlong the way I also compile an instruction graph where each node represents a basic block with edges to other basic blocks:\nRemoving const predicates\nRemember how I said I rebuilt the Python VM in Rust? I was serious, and it was just to solve this problem. I do what I've called \"partial execution\". Certain builtin functions are handled, and an individual code object's opcodes are executed to obtain a snapshot of the VM's stack and perform taint tracking. The main function signature is:\n/// Executes an instruction, altering the input state and returning an error\n/// when the instruction cannot be correctly emulated. For example, some complex\n/// instructions are not currently supported at this time.\npub fn execute_instruction&lt;O: Opcode&lt;Mnemonic = py27::Mnemonic&gt;, F, T&gt;(\n    instr: &amp;Instruction&lt;O&gt;,\n    code: Arc&lt;Code&gt;,\n    stack: &amp;mut VmStack&lt;T&gt;,\n    vars: &amp;mut VmVars&lt;T&gt;,\n    names: &amp;mut VmNames&lt;T&gt;,\n    globals: &amp;mut VmNames&lt;T&gt;,\n    names_loaded: LoadedNames,\n    mut function_callback: F,\n    access_tracking: T,\n) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&lt;O&gt;&gt;;\n\nBrief rundown of all inputs:\n\ninstr: the instruction to be executed\ncode: the deserialized Python code object for which the instruction belongs to\nstack: current snapshot of the VM stack\nvars: all variable slots and their current values\nnames: map to a vars slot\nglobals: similar to vars but on a global level\nnames_loaded: modules imported\nfunction_callback: callback for CALL_FUNCTION instruction and can be used for handling builtins or calling other code objects if desired\naccess_tracking: data to associate with a VM stack value\n\nWhen an instruction is executed and the stack is modified, the modified stack value will represent a tuple of (Option&lt;value&gt;, [access_tracking]). The first value in the tuple is the value that resulted from executing an instruction if it could be determined, otherwise None. The second value will represent some metadata for looking up instructions which contributed to generating/modifying that stack value (a basic block index + instruction index).\nThe execution loop for a basic block looks something like this:\nfor instruction in basic_block:\n    if instruction.is_conditional_jump():\n        if tos[0].is_some():\n            # Determine the truthiness of top-of-stack.\n            #\n            # Based off of the opcode (JUMP_IF_{TRUE,FALSE}), determine which\n            # branch is never taken and remove the edge from this BB to the BB\n            # we will never branch to.\n            #\n            # We also iterate tos[1] and remove all of the instructions which\n            # contributed to tos[0].\n    else:\n        execute_instruction(instruction, ...)\n\nThis will effectively remove instructions related to const conditions and (usually) the basic block not taken from the graph. These inserted, fake basic blocks are implicitly removed since they become orphaned from the main code graph.\nThere are some issues with this approach:\n\nI need to correctly implement almost all VM instructions\nLarge traces will balloon in computation complexity and memory\nComplex arithmetic or unsupported instructions will immediately stop the VM, which leaves code only partially deobfuscated\n\nRestoring Variable Names\nVariable names are unfortunately always lost. Instead of \"restoring\", I simply iterate and replace odd var names with the following script:\ndef fix_varnames(varnames):\n    global unknowns\n    newvars = []\n    for var in varnames:\n        var = var.strip()\n        unallowed_chars = '=!@#$%^&amp;*()\"\\'/, '\n        banned_char = False\n        banned_words = ['assert', 'in', 'continue', 'break', 'for', 'def', 'as', 'elif', 'else', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'is', 'lambda', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'print', 'return', 'while', 'with']\n        for c in unallowed_chars:\n            if c in var:\n                banned_char = True\n\n        if not banned_char:\n            if var in banned_words:\n                banned_char = True\n\n        if banned_char:\n            newvars.append('unknown_{0}'.format(unknowns))\n            unknowns += 1\n        else:\n            newvars.append(var)\n    \n    return tuple(newvars)\n\nPretty simple replacement of illegal-looking variable name with unknown_N.\nRestoring Function Names\nUnlike var names, function names generally can be restored due to an oversight in the obfuscator. When a function is defined in a module, the bytecode for setting it up looks like the following:\nLOAD_CONST &lt;CONST_INDEX&gt; # Load the code object\nMAKE_FUNCTION # Take the loaded code object and tell the interpreter to turn it into a function\nSTORE_NAME &lt;NAME_INDEX&gt; # Store the created function at the specified named index\n\nNAME_INDEX corresponds to a name string value located in the co_names array in the code object. The code object for the function also contains its name, which is generally what's used by decompilers to label a function. I leveraged this in my instruction handler loop by checking:\nfor instruction in basic_block:\n    if instruction.is_store_name():\n        accessed_instructions = tos[1]\n        if accessed_instructions[-1].is_make_function():\n            # change the function name on the code object to match what this\n            # scope sees as the function name\n            fix_function_name(tos[0], co.co_names[instruction.argument])\n\n    execute_instruction(instruction, ...)\n\nStrictly speaking these names aren't even necessary for the VM to run the code since they're really only present for debugging purposes. I suspect that this is either an oversight by Lesta or they deliberately left these in for debugging crashes on clients (although I'm not certain if they send back Python crash reports). Maybe there's something I don't know though.\nDeoptimizing Code\nI think that RETURN_VALUE is really the only case I had to correct, and it was a fairly simple fix.\n\nLook for basic blocks that contain only a RETURN_VALUE instruction\nFor each incoming edge, replace the final instruction in the basic block to be RETURN_VALUE\nRemove the basic block from step 1\n\nThe example control flow for return values then provided in the section about implicit returns will now look like this:\n\nFixing Bad Instructions\nThere are some scenarios where code paths containing bad instructions can't be outright removed. Usually it's because a condition couldn't be proven to be a const predicate, or there was some other factor involved that led to it not being removed. Even though I know they're bad, I'm hesitant to outright outright remove the nodes and conditions as gaps in the VM and data mixing may lead to incorrect instruction removal.\nTo correct these basic blocks I calculate the depth of the stack at the location of the bad instruction, insert enough POP_TOP instructions to clear out the stack, and finally put a LOAD_CONST None and RETURN_VALUE at the end of the basic block to force a return None.\nThe Rest of The Matryoshka Doll\nThere are four distinct \"stages\" to loading the Python module, two of which we've already loosely discussed from lpcvoid's blog (encrypted code, and the compressed code).\nStage 2 - Decompressed Code\nThe following is an example stage 3 payload:\nimport sys, marshal, copy_reg\nif id(marshal.loads) !=

from the original stage 1 file\nApply a substitution cipher over each byte\nDo some bit arithmetic on each byte of the result from step 2\nExecute the code that was just decoded\n\nIn my deobfuscator I was able to leverage the custom Python VM to apply the swapmap for me by creating a state machine. Essentially I scan for certain instructions that look like they're applying the swapmap, then execute that function with some fake VM stack set up. That code can be found here: https://github.com/landaire/wowsdeob/blob/ffeeedaea9390c1d1e9ba785360e75aaa1aa10d0/src/smallvm.rs\nStage 3\nThis stage is pretty boring all things considered. The Stage 3 code object is just another compressed code object that's been base64 encoded and had the result reversed.\n\nNo big tricks here. The deobfuscator logic can be found here: https://github.com/landaire/wowsdeob/blob/ffeeedaea9390c1d1e9ba785360e75aaa1aa10d0/src/main.rs#L290-L297.\nWorth noting that this is the stage which references the Lestas \"Anti noobs protection\"!\n\nStage 4\nWe have the final module! This module now needs to have all generic deobfuscation tricks applied to get decompilation.\nEnd Result\nThe end result of this effort is going from a file that fails to decompile:\n❯ uncompyle6

instructions at this point to understand the intent.\nAnd code objects that go from this:\n\nTo this:\nClosing Thoughts\nThere's one common theme in this post that I hope some readers picked up on: we are constantly battling the decompiler's ability to unravel code based off of heuristics instead of battling the obfuscator injecting garbage. The const predicates for example aren't even that big of a deal -- they just insert false control flow that at a source level is fairly straightforward to see is garbage.\nHowever, this false control flow is enough to throw off the decompiler's ability to figure out a single source code pattern that results in the entire code object failing to decompile. This isn't a jab at uncompyle either -- it's a great tool that works fairly well considering there's zero competition in this space. However, I think that if I were to solve this problem from scratch in 2023 I'd solve it very differently by working on a better decompiler that erodes away mapping of 1:1 source code to bytecode, and instead focuses on rebuilding source with the same functional semantics.\nAs reverse engineers we don't really care about how the code was originally written, we just want to understand its intent at a higher level.\nThanks\nThank you, reader, for making it this far.
