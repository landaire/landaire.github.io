Updated: April 5, 2017 to address some incompleteness and errors. You can view the revision history here.\n\nApplication Services is a framework in iOS and OS X which provides what's known as the Image I/O framework. ImageIO itself is a collection of utilities and data types for parsing various image formats. It's used in many OS X and iOS applications including:\n\nTweetbot\nSafari\nMessages\nMail\nPreview\n\nSome popular applications that do not use ImageIO include:\n\nChrome\nFirefox\nTelegram\n\nGiven the impact of media processing bugs such as Stagefright I decided that this would be a good target for fuzzing. I created a simple application that uses some various features of ImageIO, grabbed a small PNG I had on my desktop which happened to be a screenshot, and let afl run.\nI checked on my fuzzer after 30 minutes and already a crash!\nHere's the code used: Gist (this is almost verbatim Apple's ImageIO sample).\nNote: a tl;dr is available at the bottom\nPNG Structure\nBefore I dive into the vulnerability I'll talk a little bit about the structure of PNG files. PNGs are comprised of the header and chunks with chunks starting at offset 0x8 in the file. Each chunk contains the chunk type (a 4-character ASCII string), some data, and a CRC32 of that data.\nThe chunk structure can be represented as the following Go struct:\ntype Chunk struct {\n\tLength uint32\n\tType   [4]byte\n\tData   []byte\n\tCRC    uint32\n}\n\nThe PNG specification defines 4 \"critical\" chunk types and 14 \"ancillary\" chunk types for a total of 18 formally defined types which you can find here. Any chunks not specified here are considered unknown chunks that can be handled by the decoder.\nThe vulnerability\nInspecting the crash log of the application makes it pretty obvious that we have a null pointer dereference:\nException Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)\nException Subtype: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0000000000000000\nTriggered by Thread:  0\n\nThe stack trace tells us a little more though:\nThread 0 name:  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread\nThread 0 Crashed:\n0       ImageIO                       \t0x18699a618 0x186994000 + 0x6618\t// read_user_chunk_callback + 0x13c\n1       ImageIO                       \t0x18699a610 0x186994000 + 0x6610\t// read_user_chunk_callback + 0x134\n2       ImageIO                       \t0x18699a328 0x186994000 + 0x6328\t// png_handle_unknown + 0x44\n3       ImageIO                       \t0x18699961c 0x186994000 + 0x561c\t// _cg_png_read_info + 0x11c\n4       ImageIO                       \t0x186997b38 0x186994000 + 0x3b38\t// initImagePng + 0x654\n5       ImageIO                       \t0x186996c98 0x186994000 + 0x2c98\t// makeImagePlus + 0x4e4\n6       ImageIO                       \t0x186996240 0x186994000 + 0x2240\t// CGImageSourceCreateImageAtIndex + 0xb8\n7       UIKit                         \t0x18ad473d8 0x18abe0000 + 0x1673d8\t// _UIImageRefFromData + 0x1a8\n8       UIKit                         \t0x18aed2ff8 0x18abe0000 + 0x2f2ff8\t// -[UIImage(UIImagePrivate) _initWithData:preserveScale:cache:] + 0x78\n9       UIKit                         \t0x18ad471fc 0x18abe0000 + 0x1671fc\t// +[UIImage imageWithData:] + 0x48\n\nread_user_chunk_callback is where the crash occurs. A quick Google search for this and png_handle_unknown yields some results in libpng. Some more digging around the source code lead me to conclude that Apple uses libpng under the hood for the PNG files and the crashing image has an unknown (non-standard) chunk that's related to the crash. png_handle_unknown will, if PNG_READ_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED is enabled, call a user function callback for the application to handle the chunk. So read_user_chunk_callback is the name of Apple's custom chunk handler.\nA quick diff between the input file and crasher revealed that the input file had a chunk with data size of 0. What's happening here is:\n\nlibpng which is compiled to read unknow chunks hits an unknown chunk\nImageIO has an unknown chunk callback setup\nSince the size of the chunk data is 0, libpng gives the callback a null data chunk pointer\nThe data section is used without first checking the size of the value of the pointer\n\nEarlier I mentioned that the image I grabbed was some random screenshot I had sitting on my desktop. It turns out that screenshots taken on OS X include a custom iDOT chunk which contain some additional 28 bytes of data. The structure for the\nscreenshots I took were of form:\nnum_entries uint32 (usually 0x00000002)\nunk1        uint32 (usually 0x00000000)\nwidth       uint32\nunk2        uint32 (usually 0x00000028)\nwidth       uint32\nwidth       uint32\nunk3        uint32\n\n(Yes, the width appears to be repeated 3 times)\nI couldn't figure out what the unknown data is and wasn't too motivated to reverse engineer the rest of the function so if anyone reading this has any ideas, please ping me on Twitter (@landaire).\nThis was the offending chunk which is handled by this callback. Taking any screenshot and setting the size of the iDOT chunk to 0 is enough to trigger the bug.\nImpact\nThis bug can be triggered any time a PNG file is being processed. So really, anything that processes the image can be caused to crash. Some examples:\n\nReceiving the malicious image via text message with message previews turned on will crash SpringBoard on iOS\nEntering a message thread containing the image will crash the messages app\nOpening an email containing the image will crash the mail client\nPosting a link to the image will crash some third-party Twitter clients which try to load the image (Tweetbot for example)\nVisiting a page containing the image will crash Safari's content renderer\n\nAffected versions\nThe only devices I had available at the time were an iPad on iOS 7.1, my iPhone on iOS 9.0.2, and my Mac on OS X 10.11.2. All of these devices were vulnerable. It's reasonable to assume that this bug goes back quite far.\niOSOS X\nMinimum tested version7.110.11.1\nFixed version9.3.210.11.5\n\nOther findings\nIn exploring this bug I thought it was useful to test out various applications to see how they would handle this type of invalid image. Since the chunks all contain a CRC32 of the data, you cannot modify the image outright and then upload it to\nalmost any service. Twitter and imgur were two hosts I tried and they both would not accept the image because of the invalid CRC32. I wrote a simple Go utility that iterates the chunks and fixes any\ninvalid CRCs.\nAfter fixing the chunk both hosts accepted the image just fine. imgur (and likely most other hosts) do not bother to strip unknown chunks so uploading the image to imgur puts those users at risk. Twitter and Facebook on the other hand will re-encode any image as\na JPEG which will obviously remove the malicious chunk.\nI think that this is interesting and really important for privacy-concerned people. Before investigating this bug I had not considered additional chunks not being stripped when uploading an image to services. It makes sense, but it seems like this\nwould be an easy way for vendors to hide additional info about the device which took the image outside of the EXIF-related chunks and have them survive re-encoding.\nTimeline\n\nDec 16, 2015: Reported vulnerability to vendor\nDec 17, 2015: Vendor acknowledged vulnerability\nDec 27, 2015: Posted pic to Twitter to see what would happen\nDec 27, 2015: Vendor said the bug was undergoing triage\nMar 21, 2016 (91 days since disclosure): iOS 9.3 released and bug still not fixed, status update requested\nMar 22, 2016: Vendor notified me that a fix is \"in progress\"\nApril 22, 2016: Public disclosure\nMay 16, 2016: iOS 9.3.2 and macOS 10.11.5 were released, giving this vulnerability CVE-2016-1811\n\nIf you'd like to have a sample image, you can find it here.

It's extremely straightforward to use on most platforms -- all you need to do is pass -fsanitize=address to clang/gcc and run the application.\nAs your application runs it builds metadata about its memory state into what's called a shadow memory. The shadow memory is essentiallly a compressed representation of the application's address space and is used to look up memory ranges that are considered addressable. Memory ranges that are not addressable will be referred to as \"poisoned memory\".\nWhen ASAN detects a memory safety issue it will print a report to the console and stop the application. The first bit of the report is as follows:\n=================================================================\n==1==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: container-overflow on address 0x602000000010 at pc 0x560696424930 bp 0x7ffce1e0f150 sp 0x7ffce1e0f148\nWRITE of size 4 at 0x602000000010 thread T0\n    #0 0x56069642492f in main /app/example.cpp:14:15\n    #1 0x7fecaaf9a082 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x24082) (BuildId: 1878e6b475720c7c51969e69ab2d276fae6d1dee)\n    #2 0x56069636335d in _start (/app/output.s+0x2135d)\n\n0x602000000010 is located 0 bytes inside of 12-byte region [0x602000000010,0x60200000001c)\nallocated by thread T0 here:\n    #0 0x56069642211d in operator new(unsigned long) /root/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_new_delete.cpp:95:3\n    #1 0x560696427824 in void* std::__1::__libcpp_operator_new[abi:v15000]&lt;unsigned long&gt;(unsigned long) /opt/compiler-explorer/clang-15.0.0/bin/../include/c++/v1/new:246:10\n    #2 0x560696427808 in std::__1::__libcpp_allocate[abi:v15000](unsigned long, unsigned long) /opt/compiler-explorer/clang-15.0.0/bin/../include/c++/v1/new:272:10\n    #3 0x5606964277a9 in std::__1::allocator&lt;Foo&gt;::allocate[abi:v15000](unsigned long) /opt/compiler-explorer/clang-15.0.0/bin/../include/c++/v1/__memory/allocator.h:112:38\n    #4 0x5606964275e0 in std::__1::__allocation_result&lt;std::__1::allocator_traits&lt;std::__1::allocator&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;::pointer&gt; std::__1::__allocate_at_least[abi:v15000]&lt;std::__1::allocator&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;(std::__1::allocator&lt;Foo&gt;&amp;, unsigned long) /opt/compiler-explorer/clang-15.0.0/bin/../include/c++/v1/__memory/allocate_at_least.h:54:19\n    #5 0x560696426479 in std::__1::__split_buffer&lt;Foo, std::__1::allocator&lt;Foo&gt;&amp;&gt;::__split_buffer(unsigned long, unsigned long, std::__1::allocator&lt;Foo&gt;&amp;) /opt/compiler-explorer/clang-15.0.0/bin/../include/c++/v1/__split_buffer:316:29\n    #6 0x560696425927 in void std::__1::vector&lt;Foo, std::__1::allocator&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;::__push_back_slow_path&lt;Foo&gt;(Foo&amp;&amp;) /opt/compiler-explorer/clang-15.0.0/bin/../include/c++/v1/vector:1535:49\n    #7 0x560696424d3b in std::__1::vector&lt;Foo, std::__1::allocator&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;::push_back[abi:v15000](Foo&amp;&amp;) /opt/compiler-explorer/clang-15.0.0/bin/../include/c++/v1/vector:1567:9\n    #8 0x5606964248d1 in main /app/example.cpp:11:10\n    #9 0x7fecaaf9a082 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x24082) (BuildId: 1878e6b475720c7c51969e69ab2d276fae6d1dee)\n\nIt tells us there's a container-overflow, what address the container overflow occurred at, the call stack of where the overflow occurred, and finally where the memory we're faulting on was originally allocated.\nThe next bit of the report is the shadow memory that was mentioned above:\n\n\nThe big arrow here is pointing into the shadow memory at [06], which according to the legend at the bottom of the screenshot tells us there are six addressable bytes followed by a global redzone (represented by the red 0xf9 in the shadow bytes).\nRuntime Instrumentation\nASAN builds its shadow memory at runtime with the help of its runtime library, libclang_rt.asan_{target_platform}_dynamic.dylib. The runtime library provides some of the following:\n\nMemory management hooks for malloc(), free(), operator new(), etc. Whenever a memory allocation/free occurs ASAN will update its shadow memory\nFunctions for checking if memory is addressable or poisoned.\nHooks for some common memory manipulation functions (strncpy, strcpy, memcpy, memcmp, etc.).\n\nFor checking if memory is addressable, ASAN's runtime provides some simple APIs that are used by its compiler instrumentation such as:\n\n__asan_load1\n__asan_store1\n__asan_load2\n__asan_store2\n__asan_load8\n__asan_store8\n...\n__asan_loadN\n\nNote: This is certainly not a definitive list of APIs, but are relatively common.\nThese all essentially do the same thing under the hood:\nextern \"C\" NOINLINE INTERFACE_ATTRIBUTE void __asan_exp_loadN(uptr addr, uptr size,\nu32 exp) {\n\n    if (__asan_region_is_poisoned(addr, size)) {\n        GET_CALLER_PC_BP_SP;\n        ReportGenericError(pc, bp, sp, addr, false, size, exp, true, false);\n    }\n\n}\n\nThey take an address and size, check if memory in that range is poisoned, and reports a generic error if it is.\nCompiler Instrumentation\nThe compiler instrumentation is primarily used for poisoning stack memory and inserting calls into the runtime library for \"interesting\" loads/stores. Of course, not every load/store will be instrumented by ASAN as that'd be a bit too heavy weight and a lot of things can be determined to be \"safe\" statically in the compiler.\nI'm not a compiler expert and truthfully don't care to dive into the source code at this time to figure out how ASAN determines what an \"interesting\" load/store is. With that said, when one is encountered ASAN's compiler pass will insert calls to the __asan_{load,store}{size} runtime functions to check the operation.\nYou're Probably Missing Out-of-Bounds Accesses\nWith the crash course on ASAN out of the way, we can dive in to the main point of this blog post: you're probably missing OOBR/W in your applications if you're using C++/Rust/whatever language containers.\nThe Problem With Vectors\nHere is some example code that should raise an out-of-bounds access violation:\n#include &lt;vector&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\nint main() {\n    // Allocate a vector to store some data generated by our fuzzer\n    std::vector&lt;char&gt; fuzzed;\n    // Fuzzer pushes 5 bytes to the vector\n    fuzzed.push_back(0x41);\n    fuzzed.push_back(0x42);\n    fuzzed.push_back(0x43);\n    fuzzed.push_back(0x44);\n    fuzzed.push_back(0x45);\n\n    // Copy 8 bytes from the vector to a test buffer\n    char test[8] = {0};\n    memcpy(&amp;test, fuzzed.data(), sizeof(test));\n    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; sizeof(test); i++) {\n        printf(\"%02X\", test[i]);\n    }\n\n    printf(\"\\nsize(%zu), capacity(%zu)\\n\", fuzzed.size(), fuzzed.capacity());\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWe have a vector with 5 bytes that we then try to copy 8 bytes from. Pretty standard out-of-bounds read. When we run this with ASAN however...\nProgram returned: 0\nProgram stdout\n\n4142434445FFFFFFBEFFFFFFBEFFFFFFBE\nsize(5), capacity(8)\n\nhttps://godbolt.org/z/cecf6Pjz8\nNo crash! You might notice something interesting in the last line of the output though: the size of the vector is 5, but its capacity is 8.\nSome readers probably know that when you push_back() or insert data into a vector that's at its capacity, it reallocates the buffer to be double its current size, copies the data to the new buffer, and frees the old one (or just does a realloc()). As a vector starts to grow from 0 elements up to N, its growth looks like the following:\n\nSource\nThis is very problematic for us. We're not catching an out-of-bounds access because of some implementation detail. All ASAN knows is that the application requested a buffer with 8 bytes -- it doesn't know that in our case 3 of those bytes are unused memory that aren't safe for us to use yet.\nIn the general case, any memory accesses in the range from [vector.data() + vector.size(), vector.data() + vector.capacity()] won't be detected as an out-of-bounds access!\nThe Problem With Strings\nHere's an example that's basically the same as the vector example above -- except, we're now constructing an std::string with a static C string.\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\nint main() {\n    std::string test(\"four\");\n    char temp[10] = {0};\n    memcpy(&amp;temp, test.data(), sizeof(temp));\n\n    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; sizeof(temp); i++) {\n        printf(\"%02X\", temp[i]);\n    }\n\n    printf(\"\\nsize(%lu), capacity(%lu)\\n\", test.size(), test.capacity());\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nAgain, this doesn't trigger a crash:\nProgram returned: 0\nProgram stdout\n\n666F7572000000000000\nsize(4), capacity(15)\n\nhttps://godbolt.org/z/hdjK1WoKo\nSo the four-character string actually has a total capacity of 15, i.e. the std::string has over-allocated memory. If you tried initializing an std::vector with an explicit initializer list it would allocate only the exact number of elements needed... why are strings different?\nLet's take a look at LLVM's libc++ string code (simplified version will follow):\n#ifdef _LIBCPP_BIG_ENDIAN\n    static const size_type __short_mask = 0x01;\n    static const size_type __long_mask  = 0x1ul;\n#else  // _LIBCPP_BIG_ENDIAN\n    static const size_type __short_mask = 0x80;\n    static const size_type __long_mask  = ~(size_type(~0) &gt;&gt; 1);\n#endif // _LIBCPP_BIG_ENDIAN\n\n    enum {__min_cap = (sizeof(__long) - 1)/sizeof(value_type) &gt; 2 ?\n                      (sizeof(__long) - 1)/sizeof(value_type) : 2};\n\n    struct __short\n    {\n        value_type __data_[__min_cap];\n        struct\n            : __padding&lt;value_type&gt;\n        {\n            unsigned char __size_;\n        };\n    };\n\n#else\n\n    struct __long\n    {\n        size_type __cap_;\n        size_type __size_;\n        pointer   __data_;\n    };\n\n#ifdef _LIBCPP_BIG_ENDIAN\n    static const size_type __short_mask = 0x80;\n    static const size_type __long_mask  = ~(size_type(~0) &gt;&gt; 1);\n#else  // _LIBCPP_BIG_ENDIAN\n    static const size_type __short_mask = 0x01;\n    static const size_type __long_mask  = 0x1ul;\n#endif // _LIBCPP_BIG_ENDIAN\n\n    enum {__min_cap = (sizeof(__long) - 1)/sizeof(value_type) &gt; 2 ?\n                      (sizeof(__long) - 1)/sizeof(value_type) : 2};\n\n    struct __short\n    {\n        union\n        {\n            unsigned char __size_;\n            value_type __lx;\n        };\n        value_type __data_[__min_cap];\n    };\n\n#endif // _LIBCPP_ABI_ALTERNATE_STRING_LAYOUT\n\n    union __ulx{__long __lx; __short __lxx;};\n\n    enum {__n_words = sizeof(__ulx) / sizeof(size_type)};\n\n    struct __raw\n    {\n        size_type __words[__n_words];\n    };\n\n    struct __rep\n    {\n        union\n        {\n            __long  __l;\n            __short __s;\n            __raw   __r;\n        };\n    };\n\n    __compressed_pair&lt;__rep, allocator_type&gt; __r_;\n\nGitHub link.\nYuck. This is not simple to understand, but we can see that there's some interesting inline buffer stuff going on with the __short struct at least. I've rewritten this code to be definitely not the same layout as an std::string but shows what's going on easier to understand:\nclass string {\n\tchar short_optimization[15];\n\tsize_t len;\n\tsize_t capacity;\n\tchar *heap_longer_string;\n}\n\nstd::string has an optimization for short strings that allows it to avoid a heap allocation. Unfortunately, this means that for small strings we won't detect small out-of-bounds reads (OOBR) similar to the std::vector problem. And similar to the std::vector problem, heap-allocated strings grow in a way that over-allocates memory to reduce the number of allocations every time you push more data to it.\nFixes\nThe \"One Weird Trick\"\nThis isn't really documented anywhere, but std::vector actually does have ASAN enlightenment to detect this exact problem we're talking about:\n    // The following functions are no-ops outside of AddressSanitizer mode.\n    // We call annotatations only for the default Allocator because other allocators\n    // may not meet the AddressSanitizer alignment constraints.\n    // See the documentation for __sanitizer_annotate_contiguous_container for more details.\n#ifndef _LIBCPP_HAS_NO_ASAN\n    _LIBCPP_CONSTEXPR_SINCE_CXX20\n    void __annotate_contiguous_container(const void *__beg, const void *__end,\n                                         const void *__old_mid,\n                                         const void *__new_mid) const\n    {\n\n      if (!__libcpp_is_constant_evaluated() &amp;&amp; __beg &amp;&amp; is_same&lt;allocator_type, __default_allocator_type&gt;::value)\n        __sanitizer_annotate_contiguous_container(__beg, __end, __old_mid, __new_mid);\n    }\n#else\n    _LIBCPP_CONSTEXPR_SINCE_CXX20 _LIBCPP_HIDE_FROM_ABI\n    void __annotate_contiguous_container(const void*, const void*, const void*,\n                                         const void*) const _NOEXCEPT {}\n#endif\n\nGitHub Link.\nWhen the _LIBCPP_HAS_NO_ASAN preprocessor macro is not defined it has some logic for informing ASAN about the contiguous region of a vector as well as the contiguous region that's allocated but yet-unused. The preprocessor macro is only defined when:\n#    if !__has_feature(address_sanitizer)\n#      define _LIBCPP_HAS_NO_ASAN\n#    endif\n\nGitHub Link.\nSo why the hell aren't we getting this enlightenment? We never defined it ourselves.\nI don't even remember why I tried this, but it seems you need to explicitly pass -stdlib=libc++ and just like magic, it works. Our example for an std::vector will now detect the small OOBR with this flag:\n=================================================================\n==1==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x602000000075 at pc 0x5640917cd227 bp 0x7ffe3ad2ee30 sp 0x7ffe3ad2e600\nREAD of size 8 at 0x602000000075 thread T0\n    #0 0x5640917cd226 in __asan_memcpy /root/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_interceptors_memintrinsics.cpp:22:3\n    #1 0x56409180aa25 in main /app/example.cpp:17:5\n    #2 0x7f35ef2f1082 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x24082) (BuildId: 1878e6b475720c7c51969e69ab2d276fae6d1dee)\n    #3 0x56409174935d in _start (/app/output.s+0x2135d)\n\nhttps://godbolt.org/z/ao64GcT7f.\nThere are some downsides to this:\n\nstd::vector is the only container with this enlightenment. But it does automatically update the poisoned region whenever we insert, remove, or clear the elements which is very nice.\nOur std::string example still doesn't detect the OOBR with this compiler flag: https://godbolt.org/z/3bj6nnGxG.\nYou may not want to enable this if you have modules you cannot compile with this flag that may share an std::vector. The module that's not enlightened would not poison memory correctly, leading to false-positives. There may be ABI compatability issues as well.\n\nCode-Level Fix\nGoogle's ASAN wiki provides documentation for how to manually poison memory yourself using ASAN_POISON_MEMORY_REGION(addr, size) and ASAN_UNPOISON_MEMORY_REGION(addr, size). We can use this as follows:\n#if __has_feature(address_sanitizer) || defined(__SANITIZE_ADDRESS__)\n#include &lt;sanitizer/asan_interface.h&gt;\n#endif\n\nconst uint8_t *extra_start = fuzzed.data() + fuzzed.size();\nsize_t extra_len = fuzzed.capacity() - fuzzed.size();\n\n\n#if __has_feature(address_sanitizer) || defined(__SANITIZE_ADDRESS__)\nASAN_POISON_MEMORY_REGION(extra_start, extra_len);\n#endif\n\nOr if for some reason you don't want to pull in the ASAN interface you could just copy data to a vector with the appropriate pre-allocated size:\nstd::vector&lt;uint8_t&gt; copied(fuzzed.size());\nstd::copy(\n    fuzzed.begin(),\n    fuzzed.end(),\n    std::back_inserter(copied)\n);\nassert_eq(copied.capacity(), copied.size())\n\nCopying data sucks, but do what works for you. Note: avoid using std::vector::shrink_to_fit(). Per cppreference, \"It depends on the implementation whether the request is fulfilled.\"\nOther Tricks\nWhile I have your attention I wanted to call out some other things you can do to improve your ability to find bugs.\nFailfast\nIf you have an abstraction that's intended to safely handle memory, why wait for your test or fuzzing harness to find the bug? For example, in my opinion a span implementation should never be given an invalid memory range. We can enforce this at its constructor by checking if the provided memory region is poisoned and trigger a controlled crash:\n#include &lt;sanitizer/asan_interface.h&gt;\n\ntemplate&lt;typename T&gt;\nclass span&lt;T&gt; {\n    public:\n    span(T *data, size_t count) {\n\n        if (__asan_region_is_poisoned(static_cast&lt;void*&gt;(data), count * sizeof(T))) {\n            assert(false);\n        }\n\n    }\n}\n\nSanitizer Recovery\nWhenever you repro a bug with ASAN, try to remember to compile with -fsanitize-recover=address. This will essentially allow the application to recover and continue running when ASAN triggers a violation.\nIt may seem like a strange choice, but let's say you have a small out-of-bounds read that looks relatively boring. That bug may be hiding something much juicier that's trigger only when the OOBR occurs! -fsanitize-recover=address will allow the application to run until either a hard fault occurs or the application exits, but will still print any ASAN violation that occurs along the way.\nClosing Thoughts\nASAN is a very powerful tool, but has limitations on what it can provide you by default. When using abstractions that allocate memory for you, keep in mind that they may reduce ASAN's effectiveness. The examples shown here were exclusively C++ examples, but can be easily applied to other languages as well.\nRust, for example, has zero ASAN englightenment at the time of this blog post. That means unsafe { } code manually reading from a Vec&lt;T&gt;'s data pointer or passing the pointer across an FFI boundary may run into similar false-negatives. Ditto for the String type, OSString, etc.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/asan-one-weird-trick/","title":"One Weird Trick to Improve Bug Finding With ASAN"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cve-2016-1902/":{"body":"Overview\nRecently the Symfony project published a security advisory\nto the SecureRandom\nclass in their Security component that affects Symfony versions 2.3.0-2.3.36,\n2.6.0-2.6.12, 2.7.0-2.7.8. On most sane systems there is no problem, but\nin the event that something goes wrong the SecureRandom::nextBytes() falls\nback to a custom random number generator which creates insecure random numbers.\nDetails\nThe nextBytes() function has three methods of RNG:\n\nIf the PHP 7 random_bytes()\nfunction exists, that is used.\nIf OpenSSL is installed on the system then openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()\nis used and the result is checked to ensure RNG succeeded.\nIf all of the above fail, a custom scheme is used. This is where the problem\nlies.\n\nThe custom scheme can take in a seed file which doesn't necessarily need to exist.\nIf the file does exist then the inital RNG seed is read from that file, otherwise\nthe seed is initialized with uniqid(mt_rand(), true).\nHere is where the random number is generated:\n$bytes = '';\nwhile (strlen($bytes) &lt; $nbBytes) {\n    static $incr = 1;\n    $bytes .= hash('sha512', $incr++.$this-&gt;seed.uniqid(mt_rand(), true).$nbBytes, true);\n    $this-&gt;seed = base64_encode(hash('sha512', $this-&gt;seed.$bytes.$nbBytes, true));\n    $this-&gt;updateSeed();\n}\n\n\nreturn substr($bytes, 0, $nbBytes);\n\nUpon inspection we can see the bytes that are eventually returned to the user\nare generated from a SHA-512 hash. This is probably done to make the output look uniform.\nA red flag is raised that maybe whatever is being fed to hash() isn't uniformly\nrandom. What's actually being fed to the core of this algorithm is the concatenation\nof some counter, seed, and a uniqid(). Let's take a look at each of these individually:\n\n\nThe counter starts out at 1 and is declared static. Since PHP is stateless,\nthe counter is predictable if you know how many times the function has been\ncalled for your request.\n\n\nmt_rand() is used as the $prefix to uniqid(). The PHP documentation\nfor both of these functions explicitly state that they should not be used for\ncryptographic purposes. uniqid() inparticular isn't meant to even be random -- just unique.\nAt its core it's just a concatenation of prefix, seconds, microseconds, and php_combined_lgc() (the latter explained here).\n\n\nThe seed can be something we don't know if the file already exists. There\nare two cases where we can predict the seed though:\n\nIf the user provides a path that doesn't exist\nIf the user provides a path to a file that the application does not\nhave permission to read or write.\n\n\n\n(Sidenote: Hugo's markdown generator doesn't support ordered vs unordered lists... what?)\nPoint #2 is kind of interesting here because both failure to read or write the\nfile fail silently and because PHP isn't exactly a type-safe language, nothing explodes.\nreadSeed():\nprivate function readSeed()\n{\n    return json_decode(file_get_contents($this-&gt;seedFile));\n}\n\nIf file_get_contents() fails it returns FALSE and is passed to json_decode().\nIf json_decode() fails, it simply returns NULL and you have to manually check\njson_last_error() to see why it failed. So if the file can't be read, your\nseed is null.\nupdateSeed() fails very similarly. The result of file_put_contents()\nis never checked and will fail silently.\ntl;dr\nSecureRandom::nextBytes() will generate insecure random numbers if you're not\nusing PHP 7, don't have random_compat, and OpenSSL fails for some reason.\nEven if this isn't a very practical or exploitable bug, it shows how a weakness\nat the core of a framework can go indiscovered for so long (this one almost 3 years!).\nI also mainly did this writeup to note that this is my first of hopefully many\nmore CVEs.\nTimeline:\n\nDec 14, 2015: Vulnerability identified and reported\nDec 30, 2015: No response, requested follow-up\nJan 14, 2016: Patch released for 2.3, 2.6, 2.7\nJan 18, 2016: Security advisory published\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cve-2016-1902/","title":"CVE-2016-1902: Symfony SecureRandom"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/phpbb-3-1-7-security-update/":{"body":"The phpBB team released phpBB version 3.1.7-PL1\non Jan 11, 2016 which fixed a CSRF issue I found in the admin control panel BBCode\ncreation form. Since BBCode is basically whitelisted HTML created by admins this\nCSRF vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript\ninto forum posts.\nThis was my first time looking at phpBB and I was very happy with actually being\nable to find something with significant impact within a few hours.\nFinding a target\nA good starting point for understanding the features and flow of phpBB controllers\nwould be to look at something users would have access to with complex operations\ngoing on. ./phpbb/phpBB/posting.php is a decent starting point since this is the page\nusers hit when creating topics/posts. This controller should have permission checks,\nrecord creation, form submission, and maybe some HTML escaping. At the top of\nthe file we can see something interesting:\n// Grab only parameters needed here\n$post_id    = request_var('p', 0);\n$topic_id   = request_var('t', 0);\n$forum_id   = request_var('f', 0);\n$draft_id   = request_var('d', 0);\n$lastclick  = request_var('lastclick', 0);\n\n$preview    = (isset($_POST['preview'])) ? true : false;\n$save       = (isset($_POST['save'])) ? true : false;\n$load       = (isset($_POST['load'])) ? true : false;\n$confirm    = $request-&gt;is_set_post('confirm');\n$cancel     = (isset($_POST['cancel']) &amp;&amp; !isset($_POST['save'])) ? true : false;\n\nMostly all of the request variables used in this controller are defined a the top\nof the file, some of which are taken from this weird request_var() function\nwhich IntelliJ tells me is deprecated. This function is basically a wrapper for\n\\phpbb\\request\\request_interface::variable(). Looking at \\phpbb\\request\\request::variable()\nit can be seen that this method returns the  requested var from some associative array.\nThe array is the concatenation of the $_POST and $_GET global variables. For those of you\nnot familiar with PHP these are globals which contain the POST request\nand query vars (respectively). All of these variables are also trim()'d and\ntype casted to match the type of whatever the default value is.\nThis is a key bit of information: if we can find some place in a form where a\nPOST request is made we should also be able to make the request with a GET. Maybe\nwe should start looking for CSRF bugs?\nHow CSRF tokens work in phpBB\nDoing a simple find in file for \"form\" in IDEA I came across this line:\nif ($submit &amp;&amp; check_form_key('posting'))\n\nLooking into the check_form_key() function it's clear that this is the function\nto check the CSRF token (using === mind you)... but it's done manually. And\nfurther down the file:\nadd_form_key('posting');\n\nSo adding and checking the CSRF token is done manually. This smells like something\nthat can lead to errors!\nFinding CSRF bugs!\nLet's search the project for add_form_key() and check_form_key(). What we're\nlooking for is files that show up in the result for add_form_key() but not for\ncheck_form_key().\nThe following image is the result of the search for add_form_key() and check_form_key()\nrespectively, with the admin control panel includes folder expanded:\n\nThe greater number of check_form_key() calls to add_form_key() calls isn't\nreally concerning since you can check the form key as many times as you'd like.\nWhat we're looking for is places where a form key is added but not checked.\nWe can see there are two places where calls to check_form_key() are definitely missing:\n\nacp_bbcode.php\nacp_extensions.php\n\nacp_extensions.php isn't too interesting since that just lets admins toggle\nshowing unstable versions when checking extensions for updates, so the worse a\nCSRF vuln here does is allow an attacker to make an admin think their extensions\nare outdated.\nThe check in acp_bbcode.php is of interest though since, although the form\nis submitted via POST, the request_var() method is used to retrieve all form\nvariables. We should be able to create BBCode over GET with a CSRF token omitted!\nHere's a demonstration of this vulnerability:\n{{&lt; youtube 7NsUoE32cyQ &gt;}}\nNotes\nAlthough this vulnerability can lead to XSS, it's really not practical. By default\nphpBB enforces re-authentication when admins go to the ACP and gives the admin\na different admin CP session ID. The SID also needs to be present in both the cookie\nand query string by default.\nIn theory a timing attack is possible since session IDs are checked with the equals\noperator ($this-&gt;session_id !== $session_id) but this is also not very practical\nsince sessions are tied to IP, browser, and some other information but most importantly\ndoing it over the network isn't exactly easy.\nThe only way I see this being practical is if there's also an XSS vulnerability\non some admin page that would allow you to inject a script to get the\nadmin SID from document.location then perform the exploit.\nTimeline\n\nJuly 11, 2015: Reported vulnerability \nAugust 4, 2015: Received response from two different project members requesting\nmore information\nDecember 23, 2015: Followed-up with project members (never received notification\nof response and I sort of forgot about this bug)\nDecember 23, 2015: Vendor confirmed bug\nJanuary 11, 2016: Fix released\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/phpbb-3-1-7-security-update/","title":"Finding a CSRF vulnerability in phpBB"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/reversing-yaesu-firmware-encryption/":{"body":"Background\nHam radios are a fun way of learning how the radio spectrum works, and more importantly: they're embedded devices that may run weird chips/firmware! I got curious how easy it'd be to hack my Yaesu FT-70D, so I started doing some research. The only existing resource I could find for Yaesu radios was someone who posted about custom firmware for their Yaesu FT1DR.\nThe Reddit poster mentioned that if you go through the firmware update process via USB, the radio exposes its Renesas H8SX microcontroller and can have its flash modified using the Renesas SDK. This was a great start and looked promising, but the SDK wasn't trivial to configure and I wasn't sure if it could even dump the firmware... so I didn't use it for very long.\nOther Avenues\nYaesu provides a Windows application on their website that can be used to update a radio's firmware over USB:\n\n\nThe zip contains the following files:\n1.2 MB  Wed Nov  8 14:34:38 2017  FT-70D_ver111(USA).exe\n682 KB  Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 2017  FT-70DR_DE_Firmware_Update_Information_ENG_1711-B.pdf\n8 MB  Mon Apr 23 00:00:00 2018  FT-70DR_DE_MAIN_Firmware_Ver_Up_Manual_ENG_1804-B.pdf\n3.2 MB  Fri Jan  6 17:54:44 2012  HMSEUSBDRIVER.exe\n160 KB  Sat Sep 17 15:14:16 2011  RComms.dll\n61 KB  Tue Oct 23 17:02:08 2012  RFP_USB_VB.dll\n1.7 MB  Fri Mar 29 11:54:02 2013  vcredist_x86.exe\n\nI'm going to assume that the file specific to the FT-70D, \"FT-70D_ver111(USA).exe\", will likely contain our firmware image. A PE file (.exe) can contain binary resources in the .rsrc section -- let's see what this file contains using XPEViewer:\n\n\nResources fit into one of many different resource types, but a firmware image would likely be put into a custom type. What's this last entry, \"23\"? Expanding that node we have a couple of interesting items:\n\n\nRES_START_DIALOG is a custom string the updater shows when preparing an update, so we're in the right area!\n\n\nRES_UPDATE_INFO looks like just binary data -- perhaps this is our firmware image? Unfortunately looking at the \"Strings\" tab in XPEViewer or running the strings utility over this data doesn't yield anything legible. The firmware image is likely encrypted.\nReverse Engineering the Binary\nLet's load the update utility into our disassembler of choice to figure out how the data is encrypted. I'll be using IDA Pro, but Ghidra (free!), radare2 (free!), or Binary Ninja are all great alternatives. Where possible in this article I'll try to show my rewritten code in C since it'll be a closer match to the decompiler and machine code output.\nA good starting point is the the string we saw above, RES_UPDATE_INFO. Windows applications load resources by calling one of the FindResource* APIs. FindResourceA has the following parameters:\n\nHMODULE, a handle to the module to look for the resource in.\nlpName, the resource name.\nlpType, the resource type.\n\nIn our disassembler we can find references to the RES_UPDATE_INFO string and look for calls to FindResourceA with this string as an argument in the lpName position.\n\n\nWe find a match in a function which happens to find/load all of these custom resources under type 23.\n\n\nWe know where the data is loaded by the application, so now we need to see how it's used. Doing static analysis from this point may be more work than it's worth if the data isn't operated on immediately. To speed things up I'm going to use a debugger's assistance. I used WinDbg's Time Travel Debugging to record an execution trace of the updater while it updates my radio. TTD is an invaluable tool and I'd highly recommend using it when possible. rr is an alternative for non-Windows platforms.\nThe decompiler output shows this function copies the RES_UPDATE_INFO resource to a dynamically allocated buffer. The qmemcpy() is inlined and represented by a rep movsd instruction in the disassembly, so we need to break at this instruction and examine the edi register's (destination address) value. I set a breakpoint by typing bp 0x406968 in the command window, allow the application to continue running, and when it breaks we can see the edi register value is 0x2be5020. We can now set a memory access breakpoint at this address using ba r4 0x2be5020 to break whenever this data is read.\nOur breakpoint is hit at 0x4047DC -- back to the disassembler. In IDA you can press G and enter this address to jump to it. We're finally at what looks like the data processing function:\n\n\nWe broke when dereferencing v2 and IDA has automatically named the variable it's being assigned to as Time. The Time variable is passed to another function which formats it as a string with %Y%m%d%H%M%S. Let's clean up the variables to reflect what we know:\n1bool __thiscall sub_4047B0(char *this)\n2{\n3  char *encrypted_data; // esi\n4  BOOL v3; // ebx\n5  char *v4; // eax\n6  char *time_string; // [esp+Ch] [ebp-320h] BYREF\n7  int v7; // [esp+10h] [ebp-31Ch] BYREF\n8  __time64_t Time; // [esp+14h] [ebp-318h] BYREF\n9  int (__thiscall **v9)(void *, char); // [esp+1Ch] [ebp-310h]\n10  int v10; // [esp+328h] [ebp-4h]\n11\n12  // rename v2 to encrypted_data\n13  encrypted_data = *(char **)(*((_DWORD *)AfxGetModuleState() + 1) + 160);\n14  Time = *(int *)encrypted_data;\n15  // rename this function and its 2nd parameter\n16  format_timestamp(&amp;Time, (int)&amp;time_string, \"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\");\n17  v10 = 1;\n18  v7 = 0;\n19  v9 = off_4244A0;\n20  sub_4082C0(time_string);\n21  v3 = sub_408350(encrypted_data + 4, 0x100000, this + 92, 0x100000, &amp;v7) == 0;\n22  v4 = time_string - 16;\n23  v9 = off_4244A0;\n24  v10 = -1;\n25  if ( _InterlockedDecrement((volatile signed __int32 *)time_string - 1) &lt;= 0 )\n26    (*(void (__stdcall **)(char *))(**(_DWORD **)v4 + 4))(v4);\n27  return v3;\n28}\n\nThe timestamp string is passed to sub_4082c0 on line 20 and the remainder of the update image is passed to sub_408350 on line 21. I'm going to focus on sub_408350 since I only care about the firmware data right now and based on how this function is called I'd wager its signature is something like:\nstatus_t sub_408350(uint8_t *input, size_t input_len, uint8_t *output, output_len, size_t *out_data_processed);\n\nLet's see what it does:\n1int __stdcall sub_408350(char *a1, int a2, int a3, int a4, _DWORD *a5)\n2{\n3  int v5; // edx\n4  int v7; // ebp\n5  int v8; // esi\n6  unsigned int i; // ecx\n7  char v10; // al\n8  char *v11; // eax\n9  int v13; // [esp+10h] [ebp-54h]\n10  char v14[64]; // [esp+20h] [ebp-44h] BYREF\n11\n12  v5 = a2;\n13  v7 = 0;\n14  memset(v14, 0, sizeof(v14));\n15  if ( a2 &lt;= 0 )\n16  {\n17LABEL_13:\n18    *a5 = v7;\n19    return 0;\n20  }\n21  else\n22  {\n23    while ( 1 )\n24    {\n25      v8 = v5;\n26      if ( v5 &gt;= 8 )\n27        v8 = 8;\n28      v13 = v5 - v8;\n29      for ( i = 0; i &lt; 0x40; i += 8 )\n30      {\n31        v10 = *a1;\n32        v14[i] = (unsigned __int8)*a1 &gt;&gt; 7;\n33        v14[i + 1] = (v10 &amp; 0x40) != 0;\n34        v14[i + 2] = (v10 &amp; 0x20) != 0;\n35        v14[i + 3] = (v10 &amp; 0x10) != 0;\n36        v14[i + 4] = (v10 &amp; 8) != 0;\n37        v14[i + 5] = (v10 &amp; 4) != 0;\n38        v14[i + 6] = (v10 &amp; 2) != 0;\n39        v14[i + 7] = v10 &amp; 1;\n40        ++a1;\n41      }\n42      sub_407980(v14, 0);\n43      if ( v8 )\n44        break;\n45LABEL_12:\n46      if ( v13 &lt;= 0 )\n47        goto LABEL_13;\n48      v5 = v13;\n49    }\n50    v11 = &amp;v14[1];\n51    while ( 1 )\n52    {\n53      --v8;\n54      if ( v7 &gt;= a4 )\n55        return -101;\n56      *(_BYTE *)(a3 + v7++) = v11[6] | (2\n57                                      * (v11[5] | (2\n58                                                 * (v11[4] | (2\n59                                                            * (v11[3] | (2\n60                                                                       * (v11[2] | (2\n61                                                                                  * (v11[1] | (2\n62                                                                                             * (*v11 | (2 * *(v11 - 1))))))))))))));\n63      v11 += 8;\n64      if ( !v8 )\n65        goto LABEL_12;\n66    }\n67  }\n68}\n\nI think we've found our function that starts decrypting the firmware! To confirm, we want to see what the output parameter's data looks like before and after this function is called. I set a breakpoint in the debugger at the address where it's called (bp 0x404842) and put the value of the edi register (0x2d7507c) in WinDbg's memory window.\nHere's the data before:\n\n\nAfter stepping over the function call:\n\n\nWe can dump this data to a file using the following command:\n.writemem C:\\users\\lander\\documents\\maybe_deobfuscated.bin 0x2d7507c L100000\n\n010 Editor has a built-in strings utility (Search &gt; Find Strings...) and if we scroll down a bit in the results, we have real strings that appear in my radio!\n\n\nAt this point if we were just interested in getting the plaintext firmware we could stop messing with the binary and load the firmware into IDA Pro... but I want to know how this encryption works.\nEncryption Details\nJust to recap from the last section:\n\nWe've identified our data processing routine (let's call this function decrypt_update_info).\nWe know that the first 4 bytes of the update data are a Unix timestamp that's formatted as a string and used for an unknown purpose.\nWe know which function begins decrypting our firmware image.\n\nData Decryption\nLet's look at the firmware image decryption routine with some renamed variables:\n1int __thiscall decrypt_data(\n2        void *this,\n3        char *encrypted_data,\n4        int encrypted_data_len,\n5        char *output_data,\n6        int output_data_len,\n7        _DWORD *bytes_written)\n8{\n9  int data_len; // edx\n10  int output_index; // ebp\n11  int block_size; // esi\n12  unsigned int i; // ecx\n13  char encrypted_byte; // al\n14  char *idata; // eax\n15  int remaining_data; // [esp+10h] [ebp-54h]\n16  char inflated_data[64]; // [esp+20h] [ebp-44h] BYREF\n17\n18  data_len = encrypted_data_len;\n19  output_index = 0;\n20  memset(inflated_data, 0, sizeof(inflated_data));\n21  if ( encrypted_data_len &lt;= 0 )\n22  {\n23LABEL_13:\n24    *bytes_written = output_index;\n25    return 0;\n26  }\n27  else\n28  {\n29    while ( 1 )\n30    {\n31      block_size = data_len;\n32      if ( data_len &gt;= 8 )\n33        block_size = 8;\n34      remaining_data = data_len - block_size;\n35\n36      // inflate 1 byte of input data to 8 bytes of its bit representation\n37      for ( i = 0; i &lt; 0x40; i += 8 )\n38      {\n39        encrypted_byte = *encrypted_data;\n40        inflated_data[i] = (unsigned __int8)*encrypted_data &gt;&gt; 7;\n41        inflated_data[i + 1] = (encrypted_byte &amp; 0x40) != 0;\n42        inflated_data[i + 2] = (encrypted_byte &amp; 0x20) != 0;\n43        inflated_data[i + 3] = (encrypted_byte &amp; 0x10) != 0;\n44        inflated_data[i + 4] = (encrypted_byte &amp; 8) != 0;\n45        inflated_data[i + 5] = (encrypted_byte &amp; 4) != 0;\n46        inflated_data[i + 6] = (encrypted_byte &amp; 2) != 0;\n47        inflated_data[i + 7] = encrypted_byte &amp; 1;\n48        ++encrypted_data;\n49      }\n50      // do something with the inflated data\n51      sub_407980(this, inflated_data, 0);\n52      if ( block_size )\n53        break;\n54LABEL_12:\n55      if ( remaining_data &lt;= 0 )\n56        goto LABEL_13;\n57      data_len = remaining_data;\n58    }\n59    // deflate the data back to bytes\n60    idata = &amp;inflated_data[1];\n61    while ( 1 )\n62    {\n63      --block_size;\n64      if ( output_index &gt;= output_data_len )\n65        return -101;\n66      output_data[output_index++] = idata[6] | (2\n67                                              * (idata[5] | (2\n68                                                           * (idata[4] | (2\n69                                                                        * (idata[3] | (2\n70                                                                                     * (idata[2] | (2\n71                                                                                                  * (idata[1] | (2 * (*idata | (2 * *(idata - 1))))))))))))));\n72      idata += 8;\n73      if ( !block_size )\n74        goto LABEL_12;\n75    }\n76  }\n77}\n\nAt a high level this routine:\n\nAllocates a 64-byte scratch buffer\nChecks if there's any data to process. If not, set the output variable out_data_processed to the number of bytes processed and return 0x0 (STATUS_SUCCESS)\nLoop over the input data in 8-byte chunks and inflate each byte to its bit representation.\nAfter the 8-byte chunk is inflated, call sub_407980 with the scratch buffer and 0 as arguments.\nLoop over the scratch buffer and reassemble 8 sequential bits as 1 byte, then set the byte at the appropriate index in the output buffer.\n\nLots going on here, but let's take a look at step #3.

This is substantially more complicated but looks like the meat of the decryption algorithm. We'll refer to this function, sub_407980, as decrypt_data from here on out. We can see what may be an immediate roadblock: this function takes in a C++ this pointer (line 5) and performs bitwise operations on one of its members (line 18, 23, etc.). For now let's call this class member key and come back to it later.\nThis function is the perfect example of decompilers emitting less than ideal code as a result of compiler optimizations/code reordering.

My approach here is to set a breakpoint at the first instruction to use the key data in decrypt_data, which happens to be xor bl, [ecx + esi + 4] at 0x4079d3. I know this is where we should break because in the decompiler output the left-hand side of the XOR operation, the key material, will be the second operand in the xor instruction. As a reminder, the decompiler shows the XOR as:\nv8 = *(_BYTE *)(i + 48 * v7 + v3 + 4) ^ a2[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E50[i] + 31];\n\nThe breakpoint is hit and the address we're loading from is 0x19f5c4. We can now lean on TTD to help us figure out where this data was last written. Set a 1-byte memory write breakpoint at this address using ba w1 0x19f5c4 and press the Go Back button. If you've never used TTD before, this operates exactly as Go would except backwards in the program's trace. In this case it will execute backward until either a breakpoint is hit, interrupt is generated, or we reach the start of the program.\nOur memory write breakpoint gets triggered at 0x4078fb -- a function we haven't seen before. The callstack shows that it's called not terribly far from the decrypt_update_info routine!\n\nset_key (we are here -- function is originally called sub_407850)\nsub_4082c0\ndecrypt_update_info\n\nWhat's sub_4082c0?\n\n\nNot a lot to see here except the same function called 4 times, initially with the timestamp string as an argument in position 0, a 64-byte buffer, and bunch of function calls using the return value of the last as its input. The function our debugger just broke into takes only 1 argument, which is the 64-byte buffer used across all of these function calls. So what's going on in sub_407e80?\n\n\nThe bitwise operations that look supsiciously similar to the byte to bit inflation we saw above with the firmware data. After renaming things and performing some loop unrolling, things look like this:\n1// sub_407850\n2int inflate_timestamp(void *this, char *timestamp_str, char *output, uint8_t *key) {\n3    for (size_t output_idx = 0; output_idx &lt; 8; output_idx++) {\n4        uint8_t ts_byte = *timestamp_str;\n5        if (ts_byte) {\n6            timestamp_str += 1;\n7        }\n8\n9        for (int bit_idx = 0; bit_idx &lt; 8; bit_idx++) {\n10            uint8_t bit_value = (ts_byte &gt;&gt; (7 - bit_idx)) &amp; 1;\n11            output[(output_idx * 8) + bit_idx] ^= bit_value;\n12        }\n13    }\n14\n15    set_key(this, key);\n16    decrypt_data(this, output, 1);\n17\n18    return timestamp_str;\n19}\n20\n21// sub_4082c0\n22int set_key_to_timestamp(void *this, char *timestamp_str) {\n23    uint8_t key_buf[64];\n24    memset(&amp;key_buf, 0, sizeof(key_buf));\n25\n26    char *str_ptr = inflate_timestamp(this, timestamp_str, &amp;key_buf, &amp;static_key_1);\n27    str_ptr = inflate_timestamp(this, str_ptr, &amp;key_buf, &amp;static_key_2);\n28    str_ptr = inflate_timestamp(this, str_ptr, &amp;key_buf, &amp;static_key_3);\n29    inflate_timestamp(this, str_ptr, &amp;key_buf, &amp;static_key_4);\n30\n31    set_key(this, &amp;key_buf);\n32}\n\nThe only mystery now is the set_key routine:\n1int __thiscall set_key(char *this, const void *a2)\n2{\n3  _DWORD *v2; // ebp\n4  char *v3; // edx\n5  char v4; // al\n6  char v5; // al\n7  char v6; // al\n8  char v7; // al\n9  int result; // eax\n10  char v10[56]; // [esp+Ch] [ebp-3Ch] BYREF\n11\n12  qmemcpy(v10, a2, sizeof(v10));\n13  v2 = &amp;unk_424DE0;\n14  v3 = this + 5;\n15  do\n16  {\n17    v4 = v10[0];\n18    qmemcpy(v10, &amp;v10[1], 0x1Bu);\n19    v10[27] = v4;\n20    v5 = v10[28];\n21    qmemcpy(&amp;v10[28], &amp;v10[29], 0x1Bu);\n22    v10[55] = v5;\n23    if ( *v2 == 2 )\n24    {\n25      v6 = v10[0];\n26      qmemcpy(v10, &amp;v10[1], 0x1Bu);\n27      v10[27] = v6;\n28      v7 = v10[28];\n29      qmemcpy(&amp;v10[28], &amp;v10[29], 0x1Bu);\n30      v10[55] = v7;\n31    }\n32    for ( result = 0; result &lt; 48; result += 6 )\n33    {\n34      v3[result - 1] = v10[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E20[result] - 1];\n35      v3[result] = v10[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E21[result] - 1];\n36      v3[result + 1] = v10[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E22[result] - 1];\n37      v3[result + 2] = v10[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E23[result] - 1];\n38      v3[result + 3] = v10[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E24[result] - 1];\n39      v3[result + 4] = v10[(unsigned __int8)byte_424E25[result] - 1];\n40    }\n41    ++v2;\n42    v3 += 48;\n43  }\n44  while ( (int)v2 &lt; (int)byte_424E20 );\n45  return result;\n46}\n\nThis function is a bit more straightforward to reimplement:\n1void set_key(void *this, uint8_t *key) {\n2    uint8_t scrambled_key[56];\n3    memcpy(&amp;scrambled_key, key, sizeof(scrambled_key));\n4\n5    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; 16; i++) {\n6        size_t swap_rounds = 1;\n7        if (((uint32_t*)GLOBAL_KEY_ROUNDS_CONFIG)[i] == 2) {\n8            swap_rounds = 2;\n9        }\n10\n11        for (int i = 0; i &lt; swap_rounds; i++) {\n12            uint8_t temp = scrambled_key[0];\n13            memcpy(&amp;scrambled_key, &amp;scrambled_key[1], 27);\n14            scrambled_key[27] = temp;\n15\n16            temp = scrambled_key[28];\n17            memcpy(&amp;scrambled_key[28], &amp;scrambled_key[29], 27);\n18            scrambled_key[55] = temp;\n19        }\n20\n21        for (size_t swap_idx = 0; swap_idx &lt; 48; swap_idx++) {\n22            size_t scrambled_key_idx = GLOBAL_KEY_SWAP_TABLE[swap_idx] - 1;\n23\n24            size_t persistent_key_idx = swap_idx + (i * 48);\n25            this-&gt;key[persistent_key_idx] = scrambled_key[scrambled_key_idx];\n26        }\n27    }\n28}\n\nPutting Everything Together\n\nUpdate data is read from resources\nThe first 4 bytes of the update data are a Unix timestamp\nThe timestamp is formatted as a string, has each byte inflated to its bit representation, and decrypted using some static key material as the key. This is repeated 4 times with the output of the previous run used as an input to the next.\nThe resulting data from step 3 is used as a key for decrypting data.\nThe remainder of the firmware update image is inflated to its bit representation 8 bytes at a time and uses the dynamic key and 3 other unique static lookup tables to transform the inflated input data.\nThe result from step 5 is deflated back into its byte representation.\n\nMy decryption utility which completely reimplements this magic in Rust can be found at https://github.com/landaire/porkchop.\nLoading the Firmware in IDA Pro\nIDA thankfully supports disassembling the Hitachi/Rensas H8SX architecture. If we load our firmware into IDA and select the \"Hitachi H8SX advanced\" processsor type, use the default options for the \"Disassembly memory organization\" dialog, then finally choose \"H8S/2215R\" in the \"Choose the device name\" dialog...:\n\n\nWe don't have shit. I'm not an embedded systems expert, but my friend suggested that the first few DWORDs look like they may belong to a vector table. If we right-click address 0 and select \"Double word 0x142A\", we can click on the new variable unk_142A to go to its location. Press C at this location to define it as Code, then press P to create a function at this address:\n\n\nWe can now reverse engineer our firmware :)\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/reversing-yaesu-firmware-encryption/","title":"Reverse Engineering Yaesu FT-70D Firmware Encryption"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/apple-imageio-dos/":{"body":782,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/asan-one-weird-trick/":{"body":1379,"title":7},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cve-2016-1902/":{"body":363,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/phpbb-3-1-7-security-update/":{"body":471,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/reversing-yaesu-firmware-encryption/":{"body":3633,"title":7}},"length":6},"lang":"English"};
